# "A large part of Windows' power is hidden—*under the hood*—in programs and processes that Microsoft doesn't want normal users to see."

# "Almost any form of configuration you do to a Windows system involves editing the Registry..."

# registry components 
(Meyers et al., 2023, p. 458)

--

* ### `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` ("Pretty much everything that has to do with files on the system is defined by a class object")

--

* ### `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` ("stores the current user settings") and `HKEY_USERS` ("all of the personalized information for each user")

--

* ### `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` ("contains all the data for a system's non-user-specific configurations")

--

* ### `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG` ("defines which [option] is currently being used")

# "The most common scenario where you need to access the Registry directly is when you're directed to do so by a tech support Web site, a vendor's patch, or a tech support technician. Be careful!"

# file extensions and file types

---

# why talk about file extensions in this lecture?

--

* ## it's related to the idea of operating systems functioning as collections of files

--

* ## the Windows Registry determines how to handle different file extensions

--

* ## the Windows Registry determines **whether you even see file extensions**

--

* ## (also, this is super important for other ICT classes)

# "CPUs run *threads*—bits of programs that are fed into the CPU"

# "A program is machine code, manifesting as a file, that the CPU can read from RAM."

(Meyers et al., 2023, p. 475)

---

class: center, middle

# "When you click on the file, a copy of the program is loaded form the hard drive onto RAM. At this point the program is running and is called a process. As the CPU runs the program, it grabs a few lines of code from RAM and processes them."

(Meyers et al., 2023, p. 475)
