### "Federal employees received a 'fork in the road' email highly reminiscent of Musk’s Twitter ultimatum, encouraging them to resign, sent from an insecure server. A bunch of goons, some of them actual teenagers, reportedly got access to the US Treasury systems. (Read-only, reportedly, for now.) Longtime civil servants were locked out of the personnel systems that, by the way, house the personal data for government employees. Musk’s lackeys are in control of the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration. They’ve gotten ahold of classified information, and are now shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Musk said he 'spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.'"

### "A WIRED review of message boards, encrypted channels, social media platforms, online search trends, and public statements from influencers and lawmakers suggests that Musk and the actions of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) organization have come to dominate discussions among far-right and extremist communities."

Gilbert, D. (2025, February 5). The far right has a new hero: Elon Musk. *WIRED*. https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-new-leader-elon-musk/

## "Mark Zuckerberg can see the finish line. He is so close to getting what he has wanted for years. The U.S. government is trying to give him the greatest gift he could possibly imagine: A TikTok ban. This would be U.S. intervention against the most credible competitor Meta has seen in years, and U.S. intervention to kill a superior product to the benefit of an American company."

Koebler, J. (2025, January 16). Donald Trump has Mark Zuckerberg.... *404 Media*. https://www.404media.co/a-tiktok-ban-is-a-gift-to-meta-and-instagram/
