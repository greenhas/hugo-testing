class: center, middle

# who is responsible for ethical research?

---

class: center, middle

# "I would say organizations like the IRB help start that conversation, but in the end it's up to the researchers to chose to conduct their research ethically."

Jenna

# "I do have a similar question."

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "I understand why much of our ethic considerations are a case by case basis, but it's a bit scary to think of it being our call as the researchers!"

# "ethics isn’t just about having one 'correct' answer"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "Something can be legal but that does not mean it is ethical and vice versa."

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

## "Still, it remains debatableas to whether following a website’s terms and conditions is a legal requirement foracademic researchers whose work benefit the knowledge level of society at large"

franzke et al. (2019)

# "Is this what you were referring to when you mentioned being antagonistic with the companies?"

class: center, middle

# "A lot of us discussed using multiple social media websites as our venues. What if different sites have different ethical expectations?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "Ethical guidelines usually focus on protecting research participants, but researchers themselves can be at serious risk too."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

## "As well, simply reviewing and curating, e.g., videos of beheadings and other forms of extreme violence can have serious consequences for researchers’ psychological health and well-being that in turn require – *ethically, if not always legally* – one or more therapeutic counter-measures as part of the research project and process (VOX-Pol, 2018)."

franzke et al. (2019)

class: center, middle

# "What is the potential harm or risk for individuals, for online communities, for researchers,
for research?"

Markham & Buchanan (2012)

# "A question I've been pondering a little as somebody researching a hostile internet community lol!"

# the public vs. the private

---

class: center, middle

# "I know it's a little cynical, but even having the expectation of privacy on the internet anymore seems a little naive."

Lauren

# "At this point though, it seems like the general public doesn't really care."

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "if people are posting in a public space, researchers have less responsibility to protect their privacy. But does that mean everything posted online is automatically 'fair game'?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "People may operate in public spaces but maintain strong perceptions orexpectations of privacy"

Markham & Buchanan (2012)

# "When might it not be possible to obtain informed consent?"

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

# "If an actual quote is included, it might give a hint as to who that person is."

Jenna

# "I think it might be based on the preference of the subjects also."

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "How do researchers decide when anonymity is ethical vs. when it’s paternalistic?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "I often 'reconstruct' quotes from my social media data"

Spencer

Lauren

# "As long as the idea is still captured, it could still be workable."

Amanda
