# "A third perspective on knowing focuses on the way knowledge is distributed in the world among individuals, the tools, artifacts, and books that they use, and the communities and practices in which they participate."

# stages of backwards design:

## 1. Identify desired results

## 2. Determine acceptable evidence

## 3. Plan learning experiences and instruction

---

class: center, middle

# "I teach Community Nutrition Program Development, and explaining that evaluation is the most important aspect of any program design is always a challenge. It's hard to wrap your head around how meaningless a campaign (or in this case, curriculum) would be without a way to evaluate it."

Lauren

class: center, middle

# "backward design calls for us to make our goals or standards specific and concrete, in terms of assessment evidence, aswe begin to plan a unit or course."

Wiggins & McTighe (2005)

# "This is right on point!!!"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "This reminds me of the SMART goals. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. I think that applying SMART goals to different areas can be incredibly effective!"

Jenna

class: center, middle

# "perhaps I'd go more with students as 'active clients,' where we do not only conisder them as consumers but also as people who are able to produce as well"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "I do believe structure is important however sometimes professors do get caught up ensuring the lesson is taught from a textbook perspective instead of what is applicable–so I am happy to hear that."

Jo-Anna

# "I saw this a lot in high school where the teacher only cared about 'covering the topic' so the exam would be the same date."

Jo-Anna

## "In addition to external standards, we must also factor in the needs of our many and varied students when designing learning experiences"

(Wiggins & McTighe, 2005)

## "I agree with this statement in that diversity, inclusion, and equality lead to a safe space for students to succeed. I like the fact that instructions are designed with this in mind."

Albert

# "A lot of us are moving towards specific interests and career paths that may require different approoaches."

Amanda

class: center, middle

# "Why is this done differently? Is it because of efficiency or simply because the 'normal' way is better for most teachers?"

Jenna

class: center, middle

# "No guiding intellectual purposeor clear priorities frame the learning experience."

(Wiggins & McTighe, 2005)

# "Is this reminding anyone else of research with no theory or framework?"
