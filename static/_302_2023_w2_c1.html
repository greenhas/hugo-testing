#what is content?

---

# two defining characteristics of content

According to [Barker](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content/), content is information that is:

--

* created by editorial process, and

--

* intended for consumption by a human audience

--

Why does this matter? 

--

> *These two characteristics differentiate content from other types of data which might be created through more [derivative] processes (swiping a credit card on a terminal, for instance), and intended for other types of audiences (machine processing, or instance) or usages.*

# this gets fuzzy fast

 According to [Barker](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/editorial-process/), the editorial process is: 
 
 > *The process by which content is created. The editorial process is iterative and highly subjective. Editorial process is what separates content from simple data or information.*

# how does technology fit in with the editorial process?

Horgan, C. (2021, August 29). We used to write: How to keep writing human in a world of A.I. tools. *OneZero*. https://onezero.medium.com/we-used-to-write-bfed4d4eefca

> *Worries about how technology affects writing — that is to say, handwriting — are older than personal computers and word processors. In a short 1938 editorial, the New York Times briefly contemplated the history of the lead pencil, concluding that “writing with one’s own hand seems to be disappearing, and the universal typewriter may swallow all.” As far as [the] typewriter’s QWERTY keyboard is concerned, this proved to be an accurate prediction. That arrangement of keys remains the standard for desktop, laptop, and mobile keyboards.*

> *“Apps like these aim to bring our text in line with an algorithmic norm,” Crystal Chokshi [wrote](https://reallifemag.com/recommended-writing/) at RealLife in January. “They define ‘good’ writing as efficient writing; and according to their marketing campaigns, writing can be efficient because its hallmarks are pattern and repetition.” Computer-generated writing, in other words, assumes Heidegger’s fear as foundational: that everyone’s writing should look the same.*

> *Computer-assisted writing tools in the form of things like spell check or auto-correct have been standard for years, available to anyone using a word processing program like Microsoft’s Word, Apple’s Pages, or Google Docs. Lately, those companies have expanded their offerings to their email services, scanning text and offering up pre-composed responses to messages. When Google’s Gmail hit 15, the company noted the apparent popularity of its artificial writing assistant, SmartCompose. “It’s already saved people from typing over 1 billion characters each week — that’s enough to fill the pages of 1,000 copies of ‘Lord of the Rings,’ Google boasted.*

"A couple of days after issuing its apology in May, Warner Bros. Discovery warned that fixing the credits across its platform 'could take weeks' because it needed time for the data to be transferred, checked, and finalized. 'It is not as simple as pressing a button,' said one studio insider to Deadline."
