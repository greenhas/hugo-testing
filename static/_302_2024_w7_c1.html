# "A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content."

# "Way back in the beginning, or at least the early 1990s, the Internet was made up of a bunch of websites constructed from hand-coded strands of HTML."

# "When [GeoCities](https://blog.geocities.institute/) launched in 1995, there were only a few million people on the Internet. The service provided an interface for users to more easily build and publish their sites, and it hosted domains and thematic directories‚Äîit was, in essence, one of the first freely and widely available content management systems."

# "However, I feel like you can tell when a website is made with it, as a lot of websites have the same kind of look and structure; I feel like a lot of creativity and personalization have been stripped from websites."

# "Facebook actively encouraged struggling news sites to pivot to video, laying off some of their text-oriented employees in favor of video producers. But contrary to the story painted by Facebook‚Äôs numbers, few people were interested in watching them, and those expensive investments fell flat."

# content management systems


You can make some (blurry) distinctions between the following categories of CMS (see Barker's *Web Content Management*, [chapter 1](https://deanebarker.net/books/squirrel/the-basics/):

--

* ### web content management

--

* ### enterprise content management 

--

* ### component content management systems

--

* ### records management

--

* ### learning management systems

--

* ### digital asset management

## "Wix is releasing new generative AI tools that can produce entire SEO-optimized blog posts, right down to the imagery. Available now for English-speaking users of the website builder, Wix says its new tools can create ‚ÄúAI-generated drafts or outlines‚Äù that real human writers can use as a foundation to create blog posts that maintain ‚Äúthe quality and authenticity of user-generated content."

Weatherbed, J. (2024, July 31). Wix's AI will now write whole blog posts for you. *The Verge*. https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210304/wix-ai-website-builder-seo-blog-posts

## "Wix is being blunt about why these tools exist: SEO-optimized blog posts get ranked higher on Google, and Google results drive people to websites. Now, with AI tools, you don‚Äôt even have to write the blog posts yourself. The result will be a web further filled with AI-generated garbage at the expense of legitimate, genuinely useful information."
