# "content is the raw data, while presentation is how it's shown"

Mauricio Harp

---

class: center, middle

# "The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered."

Deane Barker, [Web Content Management glossary](https://deanebarker.net/tech/glossary/presentation/)

# how is our reading on the Reddit blackout related to presentation?

---

class: center, middle

# "disabled users relied on third-party apps to change how Reddit content was displayed to make it more accessible...  When Reddit's changes blocked these apps, the content was still there, but the way it was presented became harder for disabled users to access"

Sayana Adhikari

# "the content has not changed with reddit, the issue is that the presentation has been changed"

AJ Hotko

# "In the article, a lot of the accessibility features that they describe are meant to alter the presentation of the content rather than the content itself."

Chauncey Livingston

# how do you all adjust presentation when consuming content?

---

class: center, middle

# "When I am consuming content i often make changes like increasing font size. A change like this changes the presentation without changing the core content."

Dylan Ammons

# "I’ve noticed that a lot of programs and websites default to dark mode when you first sign in, which I really don’t like, so I go into the settings and change it to light mode"

# "If I need to concentrate, I usually have a text-to-speech read it to me."

Omari Chaplin

class: center, middle

# One in four Americans are disabled and have varying access needs, such as... the ability to modify how text is displayed. Greater accessibility often benefits people in ways they don’t even notice. Enlarged text or changed contrast are access features, for example, and fans of dark mode can thank the disability community.

# separating content and presentation

---

class: center, middle

# "The idea that content should be separate from presentation is so central to content management that’s it’s become a cliché"

Deane Barker, [Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/examining-the-separation-between-presentation-and-content/)

# "An content creator can solely focus on the content they are creating meanwhile, their producer might work on how aesthetics and appeal."

Avery Mason

# responsive design!

---

class: center, middle

# "This also lets people implement things like accessibility features to change the presentation of the content for easier access."

Chauncey Livingston

# "Separating content from presentation allows for easy updates to either without affecting the other."

Rael Kapanga

class: center, middle

# "Keeping content and presentation separate is important because it lets you show the same content in different ways."

Nhi Nguyen

# two types of separation 

## (from source cited in Barker, [Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/examining-the-separation-between-presentation-and-content/)):

--

* ### "Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the 'presentation' is the use of colors, fonts, etc."

--

* ### "Content from other content, so Content A is independent from Content B, and the 'presentation' is the potential combination of the two"

# how is this related to content aggregation and templates?

---

class: center, middle

# "There can also be one content model but several templates and presentations, as these different templates/presentations are still based on the same content model even though they appear differently."
