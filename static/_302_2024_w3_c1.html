# content moderation

Gillespie, T. (2018). *Custodians of the internet: Platforms, content moderation, and the hidden decision that shape social media.* Yale University Press

> *Social media platforms arose out of the exquisite chaos of the web. Many were designed by people who were inspired by (or at least hoping to profit from) the freedom the web promised, to host and extend all that participation, expression, and social connection.*

--

> *But as these platforms grew, that chaos and contention quickly found its way back onto them, and for obvious reasons: if I want to say something, whether it is inspiring or reprehensible, I want to say it where others will hear me.*

--

> *Social media platforms put more people in direct contact with one another, afford them new opportunities to speak and interact with a wider range of people, and organize them into networked publics.*

--

> *Though the benefits of this may be obvious, and even seem utopian at times, the perils are also painfully apparent, more so every day: the pornographic, the obscene, the violent, the illegal, the abusive, and the hateful.*

> *In India, Twitter’s third largest market, the company filed a case earlier this year to contest the government’s order to remove individual pieces of content as well as whole accounts that the government considers a risk to India’s security or sovereignty.*

> *They show up, insist that they’re the “platform for free speech” without quite understanding what that actually means, and then they quickly discover a whole bunch of fairly fundamental ideas, institute a bunch of rapid (often sloppy) changes… and in the end, they basically all end up in the same general vicinity, with just a few small differences on the margin.*
