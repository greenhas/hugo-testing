# Reddit as "model organism"

---

class: center, middle

# "In biology, “model organisms” refer to species which have been selected for intensive examination by the research community in order to shed light on key biological processes such as fundamental properties of living cells."

Tufekci, Z. (2014). Big questions for social media Big Data: Representativeness, validity and other methodological pitfalls. *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*, *8*(1), Article 1.

---

class: center, middle

# "model organisms can be unrepresentative of their taxa, and more importantly, may be skewed with regard to the importance of mechanisms in their taxa. They are chosen because they don’t die easily in confinement and therefore encapsulate mechanisms specific to surviving in captivity—a trait that may not be shared with species not chosen as model organisms."

Tufekci, Z. (2014). Big questions for social media Big Data: Representativeness, validity and other methodological pitfalls. *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*, *8*(1), Article 1.

# "The dominance of Twitter as the 'model organism' for social media big data analyses similarly skews analyses of mechanisms."

# "Reddit has started fulfilling many of these same criteria, while offering additional advantages for researchers."

Proferes et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

# "What are some of these advantages that Reddit provides for researchers?"

Jo-Anna

# "What additional advantages does Reddit offer that makes it stand out from other social media plaforms?"

Amanda

# what do you think?

---

class: center, middle

# "Reddit’s subreddit structure means that finding relevant research data can be easier than on Twitter, and in contrast to the character limits of Twitter, Reddit offers researchers a qualitative and quantitatively more expansive dataset."

Proferes et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

# "Reddit’s official API is free and publicly available and provides an array of functions."

Proferes et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

# Pushshift update!

---

class: center, middle

# "users may feel as though they can speak freely on Reddit as a result of fairly permissive content policies and the anonymity afforded"

Proferes et al. 

# "I feel like this is practically all social media…"

# research ethics

---

# "Interesting how it keeps coming up that so much research is vague or ambiguous when it comes to discussing ethics!"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "For example, r/depression and r/SuicideWatch state all research-related posts and surveys must be approved by the moderator team"

Proferes et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

# "Very interesting that the moderators are aware of researchers and want to interact with them!"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "Transgender YouTubers have had their images collected without consent to train facial recognition software and as a part of automatic-gender recognition research and development (Vincent, 2017)."

Proferes et al. (2021)

class: center, middle

# "a group of Danish researchers were criticized after they publicly released a data set of nearly 70,000 users of the online dating site OkCupid, which included “usernames, age, gender, location, what kind of relationship (or sex) they are interested in, personality traits, and answers to thousands of personal profiling questions used by the site” (Zimmer, 2018)."

Proferes et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

# "this is why people are so skeptical about having research done in this context."

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "r/IndianCountry prohibits unauthorized research and requests that anyone inter-ested in using the subreddit for research purposes mustcomplete a form for review by moderators"

Proferes et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

# "What was once limited to physically embedded fieldwork can now be done through online engagement. But does this shift make ethnography more accessible or just introduce new ethical complications?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Is this implying that the other 87% of studies didn't use IRB at all?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "I began asking myself the question of whether I was protecting my unwitting research participants in case the governor ever read one of my articles and decided to retaliate against someone."

Spencer

# "What conclusion did you draw from this?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "Makes sense. If you can Google the quote and find the account, providing a pseudonym seems to do little to protect the participants identities."

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "I'm curious to know if there was any specific reason for the Governor's attitude towards teachers"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "However, among those we did interview, identity disclosure varied from nearly non-existent (“prefer not to say where we work” [Jones]), to moderate (“revealing my identity beyond that of a federal contractor is not on the table” [Davis]), to more forthcoming (“I co-run with another person who is an actual [agency] employee” [Johnson])."

# methodological specificity

---

class: center, middle

# "This reminds me of the shift from small focus groups to massive-scale social media analysis. But does scaling up data mean we get better insights, or just more noise? There’s something to be said for depth over sheer volume."

Lauren

# "naturalistic analysis techniques"

Fenton & Parry (2022)

---

class: center, middle 

# "That's something I've noticed a lot, especially in internet research! Lots of people have different definitions of everything under the sun!"

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "authors did not provide a description of their dataset with enough specificity to parse out, for example, the number of posts, comments, or users"

Proferes et al. (2021)

# "Does this in some way violate ethical codes?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "Yet another manifestation of this theme was the use of MTs—or modified tweets—to redirect someone else’s tweet to the attention of the MAET community. Although the MT convention has since largely disappeared in favor of Twitter’s ‘‘quote tweet’’ function, it was at this time a standard way to comment on and redirect tweets."

Greenhalgh, S. P., Rosenberg, J. M., & Wolf, L. G. (2016). For all intents and purposes: Twitter as a foundational technology for teachers. *E-Learning and Digital Media*, *13*(1/2), 81-98. https://doi.org/10.1177/2042753016672131

# "part of me feels like it's important to list the subreddits somewhere within the study"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "The famous example of this is a world news sub that got overtaken with porn content so the news users went and took over the porn sub and now it's just for news."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "In some cases, the dataset can be dynamic and continue to evolve during the study."

Baram-Tsabari et al. (2016)

# "How do researchers handle evolving data?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "In your own research, how have you been able to deal with some of these things, especially if they are required by journals. How do you ensure balance without leaving loopholes in your research."

Amanda

# "The terms'‘cyber ethnography', ‘digital ethnography’ (Hjorth et al., 2017), ‘virtual ethnography (Hine, 2017), ‘mobile ethnography', ‘netnography’ (Kozinets, 2020) and many others have been used to describe ethnography with online communities."

Fenton & Parry (2022)

# "It's interesting to see how many different words we can come up with that all mean essentially the same thing haha!"

Jenna

# "All of these probably mean the same, but do they all have the same boundary? - achieve the same purpose?"

Amanda

class: center, middle

# "Data scraping is the most complex of these methods as it relies on the use of a computer program to automatically save data from an online source and present it in a particular format."

Fenton & Parry (2022)

# "any examples of these programs?"

Amanda

# "I think SNA is more quantitative focused… will we discuss it in this course?"

Albert

# "For example, when researchers use data from Google Trends or a Twitter stream, they are studying a sample made available by the company."

Baram-Tsabari et al. (2016)

# "I wonder if there's ever any bias in such data. Are researchers guaranteed full transparency?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "Are there standards around this concept? For example, does significance become meaningless at a specific number of data?"

# immersion in research settings

---

# "I am in a community based participatory action research class and I believe this is the engagement they use. Not a top down method research but one where the researcher is immersed into community."

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "This makes netnography feel more like “deep hanging out” in online spaces rather than just collecting data. But how much engagement is enough to truly understand an online culture? And aren't you always going to be an outsider looking in?"

# "Fayyad et al. (1996) distinguished between two types of data mining analysis: (1) hypothesis-driven analysis, called ‘verification', similar to what is often found in traditional quantitative analysis, and (2) autonomous, automated pattern-finding, called ‘discovery'."
