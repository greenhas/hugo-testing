# what is content?

# presentation

> *The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/presentation/)

## how is our reading on the Reddit blackout related to presentation?

--

> *One in four Americans are disabled and have varying access needs, such as... the ability to modify how text is displayed. Greater accessibility often benefits people in ways they don’t even notice. Enlarged text or changed contrast are access features, for example, and fans of dark mode can thank the disability community.*

# separating content and presentation

> *The idea that content should be separate from presentation is so central to content management that’s it’s become a cliché *

Deane Barker, [Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/examining-the-separation-between-presentation-and-content/)

--

##two types of separation:

--

* "Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the 'presentation' is the use of colors, fonts, etc."

--

* "Content from other content, so Content A is independent from Content B, and the 'presentation' is the potential combination of the two"

--

* a Hugo example
 * "[raw content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenhas/ict302_fall23/main/content/about.md)" 
 * [content with presentation](https://super-gumdrop-60116b.netlify.app/about)
