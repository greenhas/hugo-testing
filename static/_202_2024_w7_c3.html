# "The plethora of non-interoperable data storage formats just gets weirder when you take in other information about the IT in this universe. Data access ports remain consistent across films... But that just raises another question: why is there any interoperability across enemy lines?"

### "In our world, dealing with various file formats, compatibility challenges, and the constant evolution of storage can be a source of frustration and inefficiency."

Mauricio Harp

### "it’s not that uncommon for different devices and systems to have ways of storing and accessing data that vary from one another"

Darby Howard

### "In reality, compatibility issues, interoperability concerns, and the ongoing growth of storage mediums can cause confusion and annoyance among users, administrators, and developers alike."

# "'You've got something jammed in here real good,' he says to R2-D2, as though he doesn't know it's a disk. If it's a disk drive, wouldn't it obviously be a disk, and wouldn't he know to push a button to eject it?"

# "The article mentions how Luke Skywalker has issues with the disk drive on R2-D2 and I have had many help tickets at work where I have had issues with either replacing or fixing disk drives.

Can you breeze through Fortran? Remember your Algol? Those fancy new languages from the late 1950s? Then you might be the person for the job. "
