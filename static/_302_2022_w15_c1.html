# why is picking a CMS difficult? 

---

class: center, middle

# Because there are a bevy of CMS offerings—each with different features and capabilities, and some that even offer varying degrees of extensibility—choosing one is markedly difficult.

# When a company is just being irrational about what they want out of a CMS it would probably make it hard on Blend to make a decision for their client

Jacob Hunt

# Like the CMS features being gradient and not binary, this decision also isn't going to decide on an outright, unanimous winner. They must choose the best CMS, not the correct CMS.

# I think it is funny that he says that there is a little bit of FOMO when trying to decide on what CMS you actually want to use.

# Adapting all of the old content can be challenging, but a new CMS might open doors to new features or ease of use.

# do you need a true CMS? 

--

> *This is something that really separates programs like Squarespace and Wix, from more customizable CMS such as WordPress and Hugo.*

Ethan Johnson

--

> *When picking it is very hard to decide on one that works for everything well, because they have multiple media channels that are not all just informative website it is better for some sites to use other CMSs.*

# Barker's three starting points for CMSs

--

--

* (software company will steer you toward partner integrator)

--

## start with integrator

--

* (integrator will steer you toward software they specialize in)

--

## start with a consultant

# when you are working with a team there are many components that come into play

# what considerations go into selecting a CMS?

--

> *As a consumer, you definitely want the product to "check the most boxes".*

Caleb Faris

--

> *The communication skills of the tech-literate to their (often tech-illiterate) managers*

Griff

--

> *Sometimes your time is more valuable than having a bunch of options. Hugo can do a lot, but you have to put a lot of time into it.*

Whitman Joyner

--

> *Companies prefer CMS that takes less time to implement and are can be easily customizable as it affects the time and labor cost.*

Kusmira Pandey

# what considerations go into selecting a CMS?

--

> *The amount that a new CMS fits into the previously established workflow (as well as if it features extension and how easy it is to learn) is an important part of the decision.*

Sophia Medley

--

> *How technologically difficult something might be to use, as well as if one CMS may "feel" better to use*

# how much does a CMS cost? 

---

# cost depends in part on acquisition "paradigm" (see Barker, 2016):

--

## open source

--

## commercial

--

## Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

--

## build your own

---

# cost also depends on the business model within these paradigms:

--

> *some CMS just have a standard price and others might have different prices for different parts of the CMS.*
