# "Infrastructure companies much closer to the bottom of the technical “stack”— including Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS app stores—decided to cut off service to [Parler]."

# "But what no one should do, is think that Parler is somehow any more 'pro-free speech' than Twitter is, or that it doesn’t pull down content and accounts. Because it does."

# what is "the stack"?

# "At the top of the stack are services like Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter... Their responses can be comparatively targeted to specific users and content and, most importantly, do not cut off as many alternatives."

# "At the other end of the stack are internet service providers (ISPs), like Comcast or AT&T. Decisions made by companies at this layer of the stack to remove content or users raise greater concerns for free expression, especially when there are few if any competitors."

# let's focus on power and influence instead of speech

---

class: center, middle

# "When platforms like Twitter ban a user they still have places they can go and use their right of free speech but as you go a few layers down to services like AWS and they start banning whole platforms it becomes a little different."

Matthew Coomer

class: center, middle

# "The concern is that users of AWS services will feel the need to censor their content so that it falls in line with Amazon's views, or their perceived views. This could include things like a news organization not publishing stories embarrassing for Jeff Bezos..."
