# "digital methods" research

---

class: center, middle

# what is "digital methods" research?

---

class: center, middle

# "the use of online and digital technologies to collect and analyse research data"

Snee et al. (2016), p. 1

---

class: center, middle

# what sets "digital methods" apart from more traditional avenues of research?

---

class: center, middle

# "In the analog space, data didn't occur on its own in most circumstances."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Simple counting can be interesting if you combine a good question with good data."

Salganik (2018), p. 41

---

class: center, middle

# "naturally occurring data"

Snee et al. (2016), p. 4

# "I like 'naturally occurring data' because its important to see how groups function when communicating amongst only themselves."

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "Do you think of the term as derogatory? And how might lurkers affect our social media research?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "When do researchers cross the line from digital traces that are publicly available to information to those that are private enough that we could not ethically simply collect them? For example, on Facebook I'm a member of several 'private' groups."

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "observational data is any data that results from observing a social system without intervening in some way"

Salganik (2018), p. 13

# "Big data is a subcategory of observational data"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "Economists use observational data to study market trends and consumer behavior. Similarly, in political science, election outcomes, public opinion surveys, and conflict data are analyzed without manipulation."

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# other examples?

---

class: center, middle

# search engine behavior

---

class: center, middle

# "behaviors of billions of people are recorded, stored, and analyzable"

Salganik (2018), p. 13

# "Which also brings up issues of privacy and privacy concerns."

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "How is this any different than traditional observational research?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Big Data has emerged a system of knowledge that is already changing the objects of knowledge"

boyd & Crawford (2012), p. 665

---

class: center, middle

# "The word dates to the mid-seventeenth century, when it was introduced to supplement existing terms such as evidence and fact. Identifying information as data, rather than as either of those other two terms, served a rhetorical purpose. It converted otherwise debatable information into the solid basis for subsequent claims."

D'Ignazio & Klein (2020)

---

class: center, middle

# "I have sometimes felt that quantitative researchers (not all of them obviously!) carry a similar undercurrent when comparing their work to qualitative methods, especially things like thematic analysis."

Lauren

# the digital vs. the "real(?)"

---

class: center, middle

# "the Internet, rather than acting as a transcendent phenomenon which offers a separate form of social space, is instead embedded in multiple contexts of everyday life"

Snee et al. (2016), p. 3

# is the internet "real life"?

---

class: center, middle

# "How has the rise of algorithms changed the way social scientists collect data?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "I watched an interesting research presentation where the TikTok researcher described how she tried to 'recreate' the well-known algorithmic influence within TikTok while collecting her data."

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

# "We should also account for the ways in which the platforms and their norms influence user behavior."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Makes me think of the current situation with TikTok - where the Government is aiming to have part ownership of the app. If this goes through, what might that mean for internet and social media researchers?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "How far do these digital methods contribute to or transform under-standing of a 'mainstream' issue?"

Snee et al. (2016)

# "Does this imply that digital methods primarily shed light on only digital issues?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# digital data aren't intended for research

---

class: center, middle

# "Big data are created and collected by companies and governments for purposes other than research. Using this data for research therefore requires repurposing"

Salganik (2018), p. 14

---

class: center, middle

# what is the purpose of a TikTok video?

---

class: center, middle

# "Twitter's main goals are to provide a service to its users and to make a profit"

Salganik (2018), p. 15

---

class: center, middle

# "some people will try to use these methods for bad even though they are created for good"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "Just yesterday I was casually thinking about how I unintentionally unplug/turn off Alexa anytime I need to have a serious conversation with someone."

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# data can be "dirty"

---

background-color: gray

class: center, middle

# data and theory

---

class: center, middle

# "theoretically grounded and reflexive approaches to digital tools and methods"

Snee et al., (2016), p. 7

---

class: center, middle

# what is "theory"?

---

class: center, middle

# "a conception or model of what is out there that you plan to study, and of what is going on with these things and why"

Maxwell (2013), p. 39

---

class: center, middle

# theory is often *causal* in nature

---

class: center, middle

# where can research go wrong without theory?

---

class: center, middle

# "I'm also thinking if every research needs to be backed by theory."

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "What are the qualifications for something to be under-theorized? Who gets to decide when there's enough theory?"

Lauren

class: center, middle

# history of digital methods

---

class: center, middle

# how far back do digital methods go?

---

class: center, middle

# how have digital data and digital methods changed over the past 2-3 decades?

---

class: center, middle

# Web 2.0

---

class: center, middle

# "digital methods have yet to be fully accepted into mainstream social science."

Snee et al. (2016), p. 1

# "I'm kind of surprised they said this even in 2016. While I know we weren't as advanced, we were on our way there."

Jenna

# "I think this is a statement of the past :)"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "I feel like this is similar to what we are going through now with AI research. It's all the rage."

Jenna

---

background-color: gray

class: center, middle

# more methodological and ethical questions

---

class: center, middle

# "how would you determine if a tweet is written by a woman? What obstacles can you see to making that determination?"

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

# "I know the term 'I'm crying' can be referred to just that OR someone laughing really hard. Context clues are almost always important to have."

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "In one of my early research projects, my colleagues and I assumed that our data collection tool was 'always on' and didn't keep a close eye on it."

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

# "crawling more than 1,000 Chinese social media websites-each with differentpage layouts-finding relevant posts, and then revisiting these posts to seewhich were subsequently deleted."

Salganik (2018), p. 44

# "it also raises the question of how adversarial we should be"

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

## "Say a researcher wanted to study social media response to the last three elections. Would finding 2015-2016 era data be feasible?"

Ashley

## "I heard data scrapping from Twitter is not different than it used to be-- how true is this? Now, you need to pay before you can obtain Twitter data."

Albert

## "And some companies change their approach over time!"

Spencer
