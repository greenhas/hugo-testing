# what is Hypothesis?

---

# social annotation software

--

from the [Hypothesis Mission](https://web.hypothes.is/about/): 

--

> "Hypothesis is a new effort to implement an old idea: A conversation layer over the entire web that works everywhere, without needing implementation by any underlying site."

--

> "Using annotation, we enable sentence-level note taking or critique on top of classroom reading, news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and more."

--

> "Everything we build is guided by our [principles](https://web.hypothes.is/principles/). In particular that it be [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), open, neutral, and lasting to name a few."

# My Experience

---

# I've used Hypothesis:

--

* nearly every semester since Fall 2018
    
--

* in both undergraduate and graduate classes
    
--

* in both synchronous face-to-face and asynchronous online classes

--

* both with the Canvas integration and independently
    
---

# my students' experience:

--

> "[T]he software gave me a chance to discuss key ideas while the course material was still fresh in my mind."

--

> "This is the first class in which I have done that and I wish more classes in the past had that feature."    

--

> "It was nice that we could work collaboratively using this software too."

--

> "I wish that more classes adopted this format. It really helped me with my understanding of the course readings."
