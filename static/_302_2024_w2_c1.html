# what is content?

---

class: center, middle

# when you hear the word "content," what comes to mind?

### (can be an association, not just a definition)

---

# two defining characteristics of content

## According to [Barker](https://deanebarker.net/books/squirrel/the-basics/#h1), content is information that is:

--

* ## created by editorial process, and

--

* ## intended for consumption by a human audience

---

class: center, middle

# "Content is information produced through editorial process and ultimately intended for human consumption via publication."

Barker, D. (2016). *[Web Content Management](https://deanebarker.net/books/squirrel/the-basics/#h1)*. O'Reilly Media

# "Compare this process to the creation of the record of a retail sale. There is no editorial process involved with swiping your credit card across a terminal. Furthermore, the data created is not subjected to any other process, will not be reviewed and approved. It is not subjective, it is deterministic. The transaction happened in an instant, a historical record was created, and that’s that."

# this gets fuzzy fast!

# "The creation of content pivots largely on the opinions of human editors... Despite significant advances in computing, these are not decisions a computer will make. These are messy, subjective, imperfect decisions that pour forth from the mind of a human editor sitting behind a keyboard."

# what tools make (or suggest) editorial decisions for us?

---

# generative AI in ICT 302

--

### "In ICT 302, I strongly discourage you from using any generative AI tool to create content for you.

--

### "Nonetheless, because generative AI is so relevant to professional content creation, I will not outright forbid its use.

--

### "However, if you do choose to use any generative AI in any assessment, **you must clearly and explicitly acknowledge it** in your submission—and you will assume responsibility for any errors the tool makes. 

--

### "Any student who uses generative AI without acknowledging it will be penalized on their work."

# content or not?

class: middle, center

# "When the phrase user generated content came out, it was such an absurd framing that I think those of us who were users who were generating content were like, this sounds like a parody. It's nothing you would ever say to a person. And now I talk to young people who introduce themselves to me as content creators."

# "G/O Media, who owns popular tech site *Gizmodo* along with a slew of other outlets, began publishing AI-generated articles last week, despite strong objections from many of the members of its staff, according to *The Washington Post*."
