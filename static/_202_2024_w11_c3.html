# Debian is just one of dozens of different Linux distributions, and learning more about the Linux landscape may be helpful for your future ICT career

---

class: center, middle

# Open up [this Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) of different Linux distributions. 

---

class: center, middle

# After skimming the whole page, select four distributions of Linux to investigate in greater detail. One should be Debian-based, one Pacman-based, one RPM-based, and one from one of the remaining categories on the page.

---

class: center, middle

# Do some research on those four distributions; make sure to go beyond Wikipedia. Check out the websites for the distributions, look up reviews, that sort of thing.

---

class: center, middle

# Then, open a Word document and write one paragraph about each of the four distributions. Include what you think its strengths are, what its weaknesses might be, and how you expect experience with that distribution might be different than your experience with Debian. Make sure to reference the outside sources that you used for research.

# "This game taught me that CPUs can only handle so many processes at once. It was hard to keep up with refreshing them towards the end because they would die if left for too long."

Marlee Hunter

# "There was definitely a lot to keep up with and I definitely appreciate what my CPU does for me."

Andrew Just

# "New appreciation includes admiring those powerful cpus with like 32 cores, that’s a lot to keep track of. i can’t even track four."

Ricky Chen

# "This also shows the importance of RAM and how the availability of the needed memory improves the efficiency of your computer."
