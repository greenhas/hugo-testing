# when editorial process goes wrong!

November 17, 2020 *New York Times* [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/world/europe/france-website-obituaries.html) by Aurelien Breeden: 

--

> *For a brief moment this week, startled readers of a French news site had to grapple with the apparent demise of Queen Elizabeth II of England; Pelé, the Brazilian soccer legend; Clint Eastwood; Brigitte Bardot; and dozens of other celebrities and world leaders.*

--

> *As it turned out, the website of Radio France Internationale had mistakenly published about 100 prewritten obituaries for prominent figures.*

--

> *Several hours after the obituaries first ran on Monday, the public radio station, which broadcasts in France and abroad, apologized and started taking the reports offline. It said unedited drafts had been accidentally published as it moved its website to a new content management system. Online platforms like Google and Yahoo News then automatically picked up some of the articles.*

--

> *James Whitbrook, a deputy editor of *io9*, where the story appeared, tweeted that he was unaware the article would be published until shortly before. Whitbrook also said that “no one at *io9* played a part in its editing or publication.”*

* ### administrators
* ### stakeholders

--

# 🎩🧢👒🎓

# editors


> *A CMS user responsible for performing editorial process to create, edit, or otherwise manage content. An editor creates, manages, edits, approves, and publishes content. This is considered the core user of a CMS. Most CMS functionality is based around editors.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/editor/)

--

### subtypes:

* power editor
* approver
* community manager / content moderator
* marketer

---

# site planners

--

> *Site planners are responsible for designing the website the CMS will manage. Most of their involvement will be prior to launch, with sporadic further involvement as the site develops and changes over time.* 

Deane Barker, *Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices*, p. 56

---

# developers

--

> *The role responsible for installing, configuring, extending, and templating a CMS implementation.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/developer/)

--

### subtypes:

* front-end developers (work with HTML/CSS and templates)
* back-end developers (work with the CMS itself and extensions)

---

# administrator

--

> *A role responsible for managing the settings, users, permissions, and other configurable functionality of a CMS. This role manages the system itself, not the content within it.*

--

> *The person in the administrator role is often also a power editor, and occasionally one of the implementing developers.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/administrator/)

---

# stakeholder

--

> *A role which does not interact directly with the CMS but is primarily concerned with the results the CMS is intended to bring about.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/stakeholder/)

---
# workflow

--

> *An framework to move content through a defined set or map of specific steps, activities, or tasks.*

--

> *The content can only be “in” one such state for a particular workflow at a time. When that state resolves, content will “move” to another state, and continue until the workflow ends.*
