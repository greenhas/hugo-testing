Amanda

class: center, middle

# "I understand why much of our ethic considerations are a case by case basis, but it's a bit scary to think of it being our call as the researchers!"

class: center, middle

# "I often 'reconstruct' quotes from my social media data"

Spencer

# "But if you were doing thematic analysis that could get slippery."
