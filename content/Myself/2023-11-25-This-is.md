This is a shameless attempt to profit off of whatever Spider-Man movie was coming out at the time, but it's still a pretty fun story. It continues to strain credulity that this kid could keep up superhero hijinks without Aunt May finding out, but it's enough of the mythos that I can deal with it (mostly).
