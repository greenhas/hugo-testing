It's now been over two years since I ditched Twitter, and I recently made the decision to go ahead and outright delete the account rather than leave it there to ward off imposters. It's been really interesting to explore the new landscape of social media during that time, and I wanted to put together a post with some of my current thoughts on that.

# I'm on Bluesky now, I guess?

First, I set up a Bluesky account a number of weeks ago, and I've been following other Bluesky accounts for a while (first via RSS, now via the Reeder app alongside RSS), but I've finally started actually using it since the election, which seems to be sparking some new interest in ditching Twitter.

I'm especially happy that Mormon Twitter seems to be re-emerging on Bluesky, since that's one of the things that I've missed the most. I also think a lot of Bluesky features (domain name-based handles, starter packs, better trust and safety features) are neat!

Unlike Mastodon, I'm so far keeping a single account rather than different ones dedicated to different contexts. I don't know how I feel about that, since people wanting to keep up with my research probably don't want to read my sermons (except maybe Mormon Twitter folks, so my Bluesky may be heavily Mormon-oriented), but it seems the most practical for now. Continuing the connection with religion, it's amazing how much of my aversion to context collapse

In terms of ideals and values, I think that Mastodon remains the superior microblogging platform, but I'd say the same about Linux in terms of operating systems even as I continue to be embedded in iOS/macOS, so I am not interested in establishing any moral superiority along these lines.

# maintaining platform independence

I think the best social media decision I've made in recent years is to make everything an outgrowth of this blog rather than something independent. I don't mind having a foot in Mastodon and a foot in Bluesky because my posts to both are (thanks to the wonderful Micro.blog)
