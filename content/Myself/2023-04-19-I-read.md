This audiobook was a nice way to get back into reading; I've felt a hunger for Star Wars media recently, and this book came recommended on a podcast I've sampled. It's fun to get more into the new canon: I thought this did a good job of setting up some of the Episode VII worldbuilding, and it reminded me of the fun I had reading through the old EU growing up.
