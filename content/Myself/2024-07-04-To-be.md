To be honest, the collections are starting to blur together some, so I don't exactly remember where the dividing line is between this one and the last. The series continues to be good and fun, though, so it gets this rating nonetheless!

I think one reason I like DoA so much is because it's so different than my own college freshman experience. Some of that is clearly because it's a work of fiction, but it's also because BYU is a very different place than other universities, so it's still interesting to consider different experiences.
