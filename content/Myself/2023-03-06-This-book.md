I love the first book in this series, so I ought to like this book too! I did enjoy listening to it, but I just don't find the characters as interesting, and it feels more like it uses YA cookie cutter archetypes than the last book. Enjoyable, but not my favorite... and leaving me wondering about whether to finish out the trilogy.
