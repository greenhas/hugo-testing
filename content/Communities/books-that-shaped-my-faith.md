A friend of mine recently asked whether I had a list of books "that have been particularly impactful or interesting," especially in the realm of spirituality and religion—and suggested that if I didn't already have such a list, I could put one together for a blog post. This has been a really interesting exercise, and I've come up with forty books that have had an impact. Some are more influential than others, there's a bias toward the recent, and I haven't shied away from the idiosyncracies of my reading habits (that is, there are plenty of comics and plenty of French books on the list), but hopefully this could be of value to other people as well.
