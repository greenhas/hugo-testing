I was impressed with an interview Siegwalt gave discussing this book and put it on my list. It turned out I could buy it from the Swiss publisher, which offered a flat 5‚Ç¨ shipping fee, even to have it sent here to Kentucky. It's a very interesting book, one that articulates a need to redefine and rename God there where lived reality and its anxieties meets with tradition and community. I think there's a lot I can take from it, but it's also characterized by long sentences and academic French that put my comprehension to the test. I wish I'd read more of it in one go instead of dragging it over six weeks; I might have held onto more of the argument. So, my fourth heart in the rating is probably aspirational, but I think this has a lot to say for the journey Community of Christ is on (and me with it), so I'm confident I'll come back to it.
