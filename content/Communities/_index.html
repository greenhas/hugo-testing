<p>I'm a citizen of Lexington, Kentucky, the United States, the world, and the digital sphere. Politically, I care about equality (and changing structures to support it), elections (that is, making them more fair and representative), and electronics (or, rather, their impact on society).</p>

<p>I am a believing agnostic in Community of Christ with a (mostly) cherished past as a (mostly) literalist Mormon.</p>
