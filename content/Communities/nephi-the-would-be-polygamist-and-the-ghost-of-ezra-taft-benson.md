I know that parts of this post were inspired by a recent conversation with my friend Elray Henriksen, but I can't remember how many parts, so I'm going to begin by giving him blanket credit for whatever he wants to claim!

One of the greatest ironies that Mormonism has ever faced is that the Book of Mormon, its founding text, contains a fierce critique of polygamy, the very practice that, for many people, the religion would ultimately become defined by. A charitable reading of Jacob 2 must acknowledge that this passage of scripture is not totally *incompatible* with the religion's later adoption of the controversial practice (in that God, through the prophet Jacob, reserves the right to give the divine thumbs-up to polygamy); however, any critical reading must acknowledge that it is not totally *compatible* with that later adoption (compare, for example, God's vilification of David and Solomon in Jacob 2 and God's divine thumbs-up to David and Solomon in the LDS D&C 132).

There's another detail in Jacob 2 that I think is a lot more interesting, though, and I've been giving it a lot of thought recently. As Jacob is chastising his co-religionists for thinking that polygamy is on the table, he reminds them that his father, Lehi, had previously taught that monogamy was the way to go. How could Lehi's descendants have forgotten this teaching so soon? For the reader of Jacob 2, though, Lehi's teaching might come as something of a surprise, as this is the first time that it is mentioned in the text of the Book of Mormon. Jacob's audience might have forgotten about the teaching, but the reader of the Book of Mormon never even had the chance to learn about it.

Readers of the Book of Mormon could try to explain this in a number of different ways, and different readers are likely to come to different conclusions. For me, the most compelling in-narrative explanation
