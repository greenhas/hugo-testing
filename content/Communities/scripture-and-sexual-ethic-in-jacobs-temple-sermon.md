This is a piece that I've literally been meaning to write for years; the best I've gotten before is a Twitter thread or two, but I've always been meaning to come back to it and really write something out. A recent conversation with Elray Henriksen encouraged me to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) and finally get something completed. I've toyed around with the idea of submitting it for publication, and I may yet do so in the future, but for the moment, my priority is getting it done and out there. (In that same vein, I'm using a hacked-together blend of APA and Markdown footnotes for this; it's not a real citation style, but it's what came most naturally). 

## Introduction

> "For, behold, thus says the Lord, 'This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures; for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms because of the things which were written concerning David and Solomon his son.'"

> Jacob 2:32 [LDS 2:23][^1]

[^1]: Throughout this essay, my quotes and verse numbers will come from Community of Christ's 1966 *Revised Authorized Version*. This reflects my current denominational affiliation, [my belief in the value of a modern-language edition](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/tags/rereading-the-book-of-mormon-project/) of the Book of Mormon (though the RAV is very conservative in its modernization), and my agreement with a number of writers on the Book of Mormon that there is value in respecting the original chapter divisions of the Book of Mormon (which survive in Community of Christ editions but have been replaced by shorter chapters in LDS editions).

	I also regretfully use the acronym "LDS" as a reference to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints even though I know that is discouraged by that church. I would use the preferred adjective "Latter-day Saint" except for the fact that members of the RLDS Church and Community of Christ have historically also referred to themselves as "Latter Day Saints," and I'm not confident that the difference in capitalization and punctuation will be enough to clearly distinguish whom I am referring to.

Someone turning to the Book of Mormon to develop a sexual ethic would likely consult the sermon given by the Nephite prophet Jacob in the second chapter of the book bearing his name[^2]. Indeed, LDS and RLDS figures have often referred to Jacob 2 when making arguments about the nature of sexual ethics. For example, Jacob's teaching that God delights "in the chastity of women" (2:36; LDS 2:28) was cited by LDS apostle Mark E. Petersen [in a 1969 address](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#0cf0228:t694$25858:c0cf0228) entitled *The Dangers of the So-called Sex Revolution*. Likewise, Jacob's condemnation of polygamy has been a favorite resource for RLDS critics of not only 19th century LDS polygamy but also their own church's 20th century policies (and, with D&C 150, scripture) allowing polygamous men to be baptized so long as they committed to take no more wives[^3].

[^2]: Conveniently, Jacob's temple sermon appears in Jacob 2 for both LDS and Community of Christ readers.

Yet, careful readings of Jacob's temple sermon suggest that its sexual ethic is more nuanced than a generic call to chastity (or even a simple condemnation of polygamy). For example, a number of writers have found feminist themes in Jacob's sermon. Carol Lynn Pearson[^4] points to the polygamous husbands of this passage as one piece of evidence (among many others) of an "anti-female bias evident among the Nephites" that may have been "one of the numerous causes of their downfall" (p. 223). Similarly, Deidre Nicole Green[^5] interprets "Jacob's references to women's chastity" as a reference "to women's sexual agency" (p. 88), and Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming[^6] describe Jacob's sermon as containing "some of the most overtly feminist messages of the Book of Mormon" (p. 111). These readings invite us to see Jacob's sexual ethic as the consequence of a deeper commitment to gender equality rather than a self-evident list of sexual prohibitions.

Inspired by these kinds of readings, my goal in this essay is to offer further nuance to Jacob's temple sermon and to ask how that nuance might inform the sexual ethic that individuals and denominations that read the Book of Mormon draw from it. I will begin by describing the inherent subjectivity involved in the interpretation of scripture. This is important for making clear the perspective I bring to reading the Book of Mormon. Perhaps more importantly, it also sets the stage for my first argument: that to understand Jacob's sexual ethic, we must first understand *Jacob's own* approach to scripture. Finally, I will place Jacob's sexual ethic within his approach to scripture and comment on how this placement may affect how Jacob 2 is interpreted today.

## On Scripture and Subjectivity

I write this essay as someone who long practiced in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but who now practices in Community of Christ. I am doubtful of the Book of Mormon's historicity in the same way I am doubtful of the historicity of much of the Hebrew Bible[^7]; yet, I strongly believe the Book of Mormon—like the Hebrew Bible—has much to teach us and is therefore valuable as scripture. To borrow a phrase often applied to the Bible, I take the Book of Mormon seriously but not literally. 

[^7]: That is, what Christians have typically referred to as the Old Testament.

It is important for me to acknowledge my approach to the Book of Mormon because there is no such thing as an objective interpretation of scripture. To illustrate this point, let us consider the case of the vision of Enoch recorded by Joseph Smith Jr. and recorded in D&C 36 by Community of Christ and Moses 7 by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This passage contains a reference to God weeping, an idea that (at least in LDS circles) has captured a fair amount of attention in recent years[^8]. However, as RLDS historian emeritus Richard Howard has noted[^9], the current version of D&C 36 (and, thus, Moses 7) is based on an 1867 RLDS committee's efforts to bring together two different drafts of this vision composed by Joseph Smith Jr. throughout his lifetime. In the later of the two drafts, Joseph replaced the reference to *God* weeping with a reference to *Enoch* weeping. By Joseph's murder in 1844, he had not fully completed his revision of the Bible, leaving a number of ambiguities and contradictions for the 1867 RLDS committee to do their best to resolve. 

Thus, when LDS prophet-president Russell Nelson referenced God's weeping in this vision as part of an April 2019 sermon[^10] asserting the necessity of certain sacraments[^11], this was not necessarily the straightforward prooftext he may have been hoping for. Rather, Nelson was referencing a version of this passage of scripture that was cobbled together by: 1) a committee of individuals 2) who did not share Nelson's faith who were faced with 3) contradictory versions of the passage and 4) made the curious decision to prioritize Joseph Smith Jr.'s earlier draft of the passage over an obvious, deliberate revision of that draft. If there is this level of subjectivity involved in the *production* of scripture[^12], how much more subjectivity should we expect in the *interpretation* of scripture? If it is next to impossible to say what the authoritative version of Enoch's vision is, it must be outright impossible to limit ourselves to a single, objective interpretation of the same vision.

[^11]: I have adopted the Community of Christ (and broader Christian) terminology of "sacraments" for what members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints more commonly refer to as "ordinances."

[^12]: The subjectivity involved in this example is particularly noteworthy given the way that members of Restoration denominations have frequently praised the scripture that Joseph Smith, Jr. has produced as more trustworthy than, say, the Bible. 

Yet, the subjectivity of scripture does not mean that there are no limits to how we may interpret a passage. In particular, scholarly observations related to language, history, and archaeology may help guide our interpretation in productive ways. For example, the Gospel of Matthew points to a passage in Isaiah as prophecy of the virgin birth; although the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible referenced by the author of this Gospel *does* use the word "virgin,"
