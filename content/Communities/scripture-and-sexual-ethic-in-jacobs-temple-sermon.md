This is a piece that I've literally been meaning to write for years; the best I've gotten before is a Twitter thread or two, but I've always been meaning to come back to it and really write something out. A recent conversation with Elray Henriksen encouraged me to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) and finally get something completed. I've toyed around with the idea of submitting it for publication, and I may yet do so in the future, but for the moment, my priority is getting it done and out there.

## Introduction

> "For, behold, thus says the Lord, 'This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures; for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms because of the things which were written concerning David and Solomon his son.'"

> Jacob 2:32 [LDS 2:23][^1]

[^1]: Throughout this essay, my quotes and verse numbers will come from Community of Christ's 1966 *Revised Authorized Version*. This reflects my current denominational affiliation, my belief in the value of a modern-language edition of the Book of Mormon (though the RAV is very conservative in its modernization), and my agreement with Grant Hardy and others that there is value in respecting the original chapter divisions of the Book of Mormon (which survive in Community of Christ editions but have been replaced by shorter chapters in LDS editions).

Someone turning to the Book of Mormon to develop a Christian sexual ethic would likely consult the sermon given by the Nephite prophet Jacob in the second chapter of the book bearing his name[^2]. Indeed, LDS and RLDS figures have often referred to Jacob 2 when making arguments about the nature of sexual ethics. For example, Jacob's teaching that God delights "in the chastity of women" (2:36; LDS 2:28) was cited by LDS apostle Mark E. Petersen [in a 1969 address](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#0cf0228:t694$25858:c0cf0228) entitled *The Dangers of the So-called Sex Revolution*. Likewise, Jacob's condemnation of polygamy has been a favorite resource for RLDS critics of not only 19th century LDS polygamy but also their own church's 20th century policies (and, with D&C 150, scripture) allowing polygamous men to be baptized so long as they committed to take no more wives[^3].

[^2]: Happily, Jacob's temple sermon appears in Jacob 2 for both LDS and Community of Christ readers.

Yet, careful readings of Jacob's temple sermon suggest that its sexual ethic is more nuanced than a generic call to chastity. For example, in the influential essay *Could Feminism Have Saved the Nephites?*[^3] Carol Lynn Pearson points to Jacob's sermon (among other passages) as evidence of an "anti-female bias evident among the Nephites" that may have been "one of the numerous causes of their downfall." Simillarly, Deidre Nicole Green[^4] describes Jacob as preaching against the Nephites' "misdeeds, which involve sexual sin and, worse, objectify and instrumentalize other human beings."

## My Perspectives



## Jacob's Temple Sermon is About Interpreting Scripture
