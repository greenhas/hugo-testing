This is a piece that I've been meaning to write for years, but the best I've gotten is only a Twitter thread (RIP) or two. Some recent conversations with friends have inspired me to try writing my thoughts out more completely. I've toyed around with the idea of submitting this kind of piece for publication, and I may yet do so in the future, but for the moment, my priority is getting it done and out there. In that same vein, I'm using a hacked-together blend of APA and Markdown footnotes for this; it's not a real citation style, but it's what came most naturally.

## Introduction

> "Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: 'For there shall not any man among you have, save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none; for I, the Lord God, delighteth in the chastity of women."

> Jacob 2:36 [LDS 2:27-28][^1]

[^1]: Throughout this essay, quotes and verse numbers from the Book of Mormon will be based on Community of Christ's 1966 *Revised Authorized Version*. This reflects my current denominational affiliation, [my belief in the value of a modern-language edition](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/tags/rereading-the-book-of-mormon-project/) of the Book of Mormon (though I personally think the RAV is too conservative in its modernization), and my agreement with a number of writers on the Book of Mormon that there is significance to the original chapter divisions of that book (which survive in Community of Christ editions but have been replaced by shorter chapters in LDS editions).

	I also regretfully use the acronym "LDS" when referencing people, teachings, and beliefs associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I would use the preferred adjective "Latter-day Saint" except for the fact that members of the RLDS Church and Community of Christ have also referred to themselves as "Latter Day Saints," and I'm not confident that all readers will pick up on the differences in capitalization and punctuation that would indicate which group I'm talking to.

Someone turning to the Book of Mormon to develop a sexual ethic would likely consult the sermon given by the Nephite prophet Jacob in the second chapter of the book bearing his name[^2]. Indeed, LDS and RLDS figures have often referred to Jacob 2 when making arguments about the nature of sexual ethics. For example, LDS apostle Mark E. Petersen[^3] quoted the above passage in a 1969 address entitled *The Dangers of the So-called Sex Revolution*. Likewise, Jacob's condemnation of polygamy was a favorite resource for RLDS critics of both 19th century LDS polygamy as well as their own church's 20th century policies (and, with D&C 150, scripture) allowing polygamous men to be baptized so long as they committed to take no more wives[^4].

[^2]: Conveniently, Jacob's temple sermon appears in Jacob 2 for both LDS and Community of Christ readers.

Yet, careful readings of Jacob's temple sermon suggest that its sexual ethic is more nuanced than a generic call to chastity (or even a simple condemnation of polygamy). For example, a number of writers have found feminist themes in Jacob's sermon. Indeed, Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming[^5] describe Jacob's sermon as containing "some of the most overtly feminist messages of the Book of Mormon" (p. 111). Carol Lynn Pearson[^6] points to the polygamous husbands of this passage as one piece of evidence (among many others) of an "anti-female bias evident among the Nephites" that may have been "one of the numerous causes of their downfall" (p. 223). Similarly, Deidre Nicole Green[^7] interprets "Jacob's references to women's chastity" as a reference "to women's sexual agency" (p. 88).  These readings invite us to see Jacob's sexual ethic less as a self-evident list of sexual prohibitions and more as the natural consequence of a deeper commitment to gender equality.

Inspired by these kinds of readings, my goal in this essay is to offer further nuance to Jacob's temple sermon and to ask how that nuance might inform the sexual ethic that individuals and denominations that read the Book of Mormon draw from it. I will begin by describing the inherent subjectivity involved in the interpretation of scripture. This is important for making clear the perspective *I bring* to reading the Book of Mormon. Perhaps more importantly, it also sets the stage for my first argument: that to understand Jacob's sexual ethic, we must first understand *Jacob's own* approach to scripture. Finally, I will place Jacob's sexual ethic within his approach to scripture and comment on how this placement may affect how Jacob 2 is interpreted today.

## On Scripture and Subjectivity

In this section, I argue that the interpretation of scripture is an inherently subjective processâ€”but that some interpretations are better than others. I conclude by acknowledging the subjectivity that I bring to the Book of Mormon text.

### Subjective Scripture

There is no such thing as an objective interpretation of scripture. To illustrate this point, consider the case of Enoch's vision, composed by Joseph Smith Jr. and recorded in D&C 36 by Community of Christ and in Moses 7 by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This passage contains a reference to God weeping, an idea that (at least in LDS circles) has captured a fair amount of attention in recent years[^8]. However, as RLDS historian emeritus Richard Howard has noted[^9],  D&C 36 (and, thus, Moses 7[^10]) is based on an 1867 RLDS committee's efforts to bring together two different drafts of this vision composed by Joseph Smith Jr. throughout his lifetime. In the later of the two drafts, Joseph replaced the reference to *God* weeping with a reference to *Enoch* weeping. By Joseph's murder in 1844, he had not fully completed his revision of the Bible, leaving a number of ambiguities and contradictions for the 1867 RLDS committee to do their best to resolve.

[^8]: See, for example:

	Givens, T. L., & Givens, F. (2012). *The God who weeps: How Mormonism makes sense of life*. Ensign Peak.
	
[^9]: Howard, R. P. (1995). *Restoration scriptures: A study of their textual development*. Herald Publishing House

[^10]: This article from the LDS periodical *The Ensign* concludes that the text of the Book of Moses found in the Pearl of Great Price was taken from the RLDS-printed Inspired Version of the Bible, which is also the source for D&C 36:

	Matthews, R. J. (1986, January). How we got the Book of Moses. *The Ensign*. https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1986/01/how-we-got-the-book-of-moses?lang=eng

Thus, when LDS prophet-president Russell Nelson referenced God's weeping in this vision as part of an April 2019 sermon[^11] asserting the necessity of receiving certain sacraments[^12], this was not necessarily the straightforward prooftext he may have been hoping for. Rather, Nelson was referencing a version of this passage of scripture that was: 

1. cobbled together by a committee of individuals (who may have disagreed among themselves),
2. who did not share Nelson's faith (and could have brought RLDS biases into their decisions),
3. who were faced with contradictory versions of the passage (making it difficult to know what Joseph Smith Jr. intended, much less God), and
4. who made the curious decision to prioritize the earlier draft of the passage (as opposed to the later draft, which appears to be an intentional revision)

If there is this level of subjectivity involved in the *production* of scripture[^13], how much more subjectivity should we expect in the *interpretation* of scripture? If it is next to impossible to say what the authoritative version of Enoch's vision is, it must be outright impossible to limit ourselves to a single, objective interpretation of the same vision.

[^11]: Nelson, R. M. (2019, April). "'Come, Follow Me.'" https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/46nelson

[^12]: I use the Community of Christ (and broader Christian) terminology of "sacraments" for what members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints more commonly refer to as "ordinances."

[^13]: The subjectivity involved in this example is particularly noteworthy given the way that members of Restoration denominations have frequently praised the scripture that Joseph Smith, Jr. has produced as more trustworthy than the Bible. 

### Productive Constraints

Although the interpretation of scripture is inherently subjective, our interpretations can be stronger when we impose productive constraints on them. Some of these constraints take the form of theological commitments. For example, the Community of Christ Statement on Scripture[^14] encourages members of this denomination to interpret scripture through a Christ-focused lens with statements like "It is to Christ that scripture points" and "It is Christ whom we must hear" (Affirmation One). Furthermore, Community of Christ believes that scripture must be read through a particular understanding of Christ: "Scriptureâ€™s authority is derived from the model of Christ, who came to be a servant (Mark 10:45). Therefore, the authority of scripture is not the authority to oppress, control, or dominate" (Affirmation Four). Although there are passages of scripture that are seemingly unrelated to Christâ€”or that seem to promote oppression, control, or dominationâ€”a member of Community of Christ might craft their interpretation of (or response to) those passages based primarily on those theological commitments.

[^14]: This statement can be accessed at https://cofchrist.org/scripture/

Yet, it is also productive to recognize the ways in which scripture may not conform with our theological commitments. In particular, scholarly observations related to language, history, and archaeology may also constrain our interpretation. For example, Matthew 1:22-23 quotes Isaiah 7:14 and interprets it as prophecy of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. Although the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible referenced by the author of this Gospel *does* use the word "virgin," the Hebrew Bible itself uses a word meaning "young woman"â€”not the word that the Hebrew Bible uses to indicate virginity[^15]. This need not prevent Christians from holding to the doctrine of Jesus's virgin birth, but it should constrain them from insisting that Jewish readers, for example, interpret Isaiah through a Christ-focused lens. Similarly, Thomas Wayment's translation of the New Testament[^16] respectfully notes that distinctly LDS interpretations of specific New Testament verses are often dependent on the exact words of the King James Version of the Bible and do not hold up to more accurate translations of the original Greek. Once again, there is (usually) no harm in adopting those interpretations, but there is little room for imposing those interpretations on others.

### Personal Perspective

The subjectivity of scripture interpretation and the productive constraints we impose on our own interpretations will become important later in this essay, as we consider how Jacob approaches scripture (and how that affects his sexual ethic). However, they also highlight the importance of acknowledging the subjectivity that I bring to this essay.

I write from the perspective of someone who long practiced in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but who now practices in Community of Christ. Thus, I am familiar with and sympathetic to LDS approaches to the Book of Mormon. Furthermore, there is no getting around the fact that there has been more writing on the Book of Mormon from LDS perspectives than from RLDS/Community of Christ perspectives (especially in recent years); I have not read all of the interesting writing on the Book of Mormon, but my thinking is largely shaped by LDS writers (if not institutional perspectives). That said, my core theological commitments are presently closer to Community of Christ than they are to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Especially relevant here is my firm belief in what prophet-president Stephen Veazey expressed in D&C 163:7[^17] (which resembles my previous references to the Community of Christ Statement on Scripture): 

> 7 a. Scripture is an indispensable witness to the Eternal Source of light and truth, which cannot be fully contained in any finite vessel or language. Scripture has been written and shaped by human authors through experiences of revelation and ongoing inspiration of the Holy Spirit in the midst of time and culture.
>
> b. Scripture is not to be worshiped or idolized. Only God, the Eternal One of whom scripture testifies, is worthy of worship. Godâ€™s nature, as revealed in Jesus Christ and affirmed by the Holy Spirit, provides the ultimate standard by which any portion of scripture should be interpreted and applied.
> 
> c. It is not pleasing to God when any passage of scripture is used to diminish or oppress races, genders, or classes of human beings. Much physical and emotional violence has been done to some of Godâ€™s beloved children through the misuse of scripture. The church is called to confess and repent of such attitudes and practices.

In terms of the productive constraints I bring to bear on the Book of Mormon, I am doubtful of the Book of Mormon's historicity in the same way I am doubtful of the historicity of much of the Hebrew Bible[^18]. Furthermore, even when was less doubtful of its historicity, I likely would have agreed with Bruce Lindgren's[^19] observation that despite many efforts to the contrary, we simply do not have access to the purported original language of the Book of Mormon or to any conclusive historical or archaeological data related to its narrativeâ€”context that is necessary for responsible interpretation of scripture.

[^18]: That is, what Christians have typically referred to as the Old Testament.

[^19]: Lindgren, A. B. (1986). Sign or scripture: Approaches to the Book of Mormon. *Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought*, *19*(1), 69-75. 

Despite these obstacles, I strongly believe the Book of Mormonâ€”like the Hebrew Bibleâ€”has much to teach us and is therefore valuable as scripture. To borrow a phrase often applied to the Bible, I take the Book of Mormon seriously but not literally. Indeed, Lindgren[^19] argues that:

> The most significant threat to the Book of Mormon... is not questions of its historicity. The most significant threat is that it will be ignored by the faithful. If we refuse to ask questions and listen to its responses, we will have an artifact which has no scriptural function despite our reverence for it. (p. 74)

I believe that we can ask questions of the Book of Mormon and that it will provide responses. Like Lindgren[^19], I expect that "we will find ourselves arguing with the book's answers much of the time" (p. 75)[^20], but I have also found that careful reading of the Book of Mormon often provides answers that inform my faith. In particular, Grant Hardy[^21] has provided an important model for my reading of the Book of Mormon: one that focuses primarily on what the text *has to say* about religion (rather than anything that it *proves* about religion), one that treats the narrators as real people (without going so far as to say they were historical figures), and one that reads between the lines to consider whether there is a story behind the story. This is not the only way of approaching the Book of Mormon productively[^22], and it is not without its downsides[^23], but it is my preferred approach and the perspective I bring to this essay.

[^20]: Lindgren notes that this should be expected, considering how often scripture argues **with itself** (providing examples of disputes between Paul and James in the New Testament and between the authors of Jonah and Ezra-Nehemiah in the Hebrew Bible)

[^21]: Hardy, G. (2010). *Understanding the Book of Mormon: A reader's guide*. Oxford University Press.

[^22]: For example, some authors have suggested that we use the 19th century American context of the Book of Mormon's emergenceâ€”including associated history and languageâ€”to guide our reading. Here are two models of that approach that I find helpful.

	Luffman, D. E. (2013). *The Book of Mormon's witness to its first readers*. Community of Christ Seminary Press.
	
	McClellan, D. O. (2020). 2 Nephi 25:23 in literary and rhetorical context. *Journal of Book of Mormon Studies*, *29*, 1-19. 
	
	It is also noteworthy that neither of these authors explicitly argues that using 19th-century contexts necessarily means rejecting the purported origins of the Book of Mormon. After all, the text itself suggests that it is meant for a 19th-century American audience, and as readers of the Book of Mormon resemble that audience less and less, there is value in understanding how its "first readers" would have received its message.
	
[^23]: In my view, the most important downside of taking the Book of Mormon text seriously while bracketing its claims to historicity is the way that the text imposes an identity and history on indigenous peoples of the Americas. (I owe much of this view to a conversation about the Book of Mormon with Rachel Odell). A narrative approach to the Book of Mormon **can** offer interesting, more nuanced readings of the text's approach to indigenous peoples, as evidenced by:
	
	Hickman, J. (2014). The Book of Mormon as Amerindian apocalypse. *American Literature*, *86*(3), 429-461. https://doi.org/10.1215/00029831-2717371
	
	However, I've also heard Hickman acknowledge that *if* the Book of Mormon provides a path to postcolonialism, it is at best a "janky bridge" at risk of collapse. In that same conference presentation, he also argued that it is ultimately up to indigenous readers to decide whether his reading is appropriate.
	
	Thus, while this narrative perspective can change how we understand what the Book of Mormon says about indigenous peoples of the Americas, it does not respond to the fact that the Book of Mormon **does** say something about indigenous peoples that readers have used to overwrite those peoples' own identities and histories.

## Jacob's Temple Sermon is About Interpreting Scripture

Discussing the interpretation of scripture is an important first step for this essay because Jacob begins the portion of his sermon addressing sexual ethics by accusing his audience of misinterpreting scripture. Likewise, he tries to correct this misinterpretation *before* he proposes a sexual ethic. Yes, Jacob is talking about sex, but it's clear that scripture is also on his mind.

However, this observation is complicated by the fact that scripture seems to support Jacob's audience more than it supports Jacob. In the following sections, I will discuss where Jacob appears to get things wrongâ€”but what that tells us about his approach to scripture.

### Jacob is Wrong...

> "For, behold, thus says the Lord, 'This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures; for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms because of the things which were written concerning David and Solomon his son.'"
> 
> Jacob 2:32 [LDS 2:23]

In their treatment of this portion of Jacob's temple sermon, Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming[^5], describe Jacob as explaining:

> what is even worse than what went before [i.e., Jacob's critique of seeking for wealth and oppressing the poor]: the Nephites are manipulating scripture to excuse their own selfish behavior [i.e., taking additional wives and concubines]. They are weaponizing holy text in order to justify committing evil. (p. 110)

In broad terms, I agree with Salleh and Olsen Hemming's argument. However, I would not describe the Nephite men as "manipulating scripture" to justify the taking of concubines and additional wives. Indeed, Wil Gafney[^24] writes that "From this point forward in the Scriptures"â€”that is, after Lamech takes two wives in Genesis 4:19â€”"Lamech-style partnership (polygamy), rather than Eve/Adam-style monogamy, becomes normative." (p. 28)[^25] At best, Gafney continues, God is silent on the subject of polygamy. Thus, despite Jacob's insistence that God condemns the Nephite men's interpretation of scripture, commands monogamy as a general rule[^26], and sees David and Solomon's polygamy as an abomination[^27], there is considerable evidence to the contrary.

[^24]: Gafney, W. C. (2017) *Womanist midrash: A reintroduction to the women of the Torah and the throne*. Westminster John Knox Press.

[^25]: Although it is not directly related to this essay, Gafney's comments occur in the context of an important discussion of how marriages and families in the Bible **do not** conform to the models of marriage and family that conservative Christians appeal to the Bible to promote.

[^26]: Jacob 2:39 [LDS 2:30] suggests that God can authorize polygamy in specific cases, but without explicit instructions, believers should stick to monogamy. 

[^27]: This particular reference poses a particular dilemma for LDS readers of the Book of Mormon. Critics of LDS polygamy have often noted the irony that Jacob's anti-polygamy screed appears in the faith's founding text, to which defenders have responded (accurately) that Jacob leaves open the possibility of God-ordained polygamy. However, Jacob is also clear that in God's sight, David and Solomon's actions were abominable. In contrast, Section 132 in the LDS Doctrine and Covenants (for perhaps obvious reasons, there is no Community of Christ equivalent to this passage) explicitly argues that except in the case of Bathsheba, all of David's polygamy received divine approval. Thus, in two passages of LDS scripture coming from Joseph Smith Jr., we find two clearly different interpretations of the same Bible story, further emphasizing the impossibility of objective interpretation of scripture.

 In fact, while Jacob implies that Nephite advocates for polygamy have been referencing David and Solomon in particular, there are far more compelling passages that they could have turned to in order to make their case. Just after Moses receives the Ten Commandments, God's next conversation with him is to establish laws that governâ€”not forbid!â€”slavery (see Exodus 21:1-11). Implicit in these laws is divine permission for a man to purchase a woman as a slave to whom he has sexual accessâ€”and to purchase additional women if, as described in Robert Alter's footnotes[^28], "he finds anything about [the first woman] that disinclines him to keep her as a sexual partner" (p. 301)[^29]. Nothing in Jacob 2 explicitly suggests that Nephite men were also advocating for sex slavery[^30], but if they had wanted to, they would have had a scriptural foundation to support their argument.

[^28]: Alter, R. (2019). *The Hebrew Bible: A Translation with Commentary. Volume 1: The Five Books of Moses*. W. W. Norton & Company.

[^29]: In the interest of heading off possible objections to my interpretation of these passages, I acknowledge that at least some of these laws regarding sex slaves are meant to make their treatment less severe; however, "less severe sex slavery" is still inexcusably awful. Likewise, I invite in particular any member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who wants to defend a divine allowance of sex slavery as accommodating the culture of the time to consider whether *The Family: A Proclamation to the World* is likewise an accommodation to the mid-20th century culture in which its authors were raised.

[^30]: However, note the command in 2:42 [LDS 2:33] that "they shall not lead away captive the daughers of my people." I'm inclined to interpret this as a reference to sex slavery, because it supports what I see Jacob as doing here (i.e., rejecting the sexual ethic of the Hebrew Bible in favor of a better one and insisting that God must be on his side), but it's also quite possible that this is just a metaphorical reference to captivity, so I'm burying it here in a footnote rather than making it a key part of my argument.

Jacob's insistence that the scriptures are on his side when he preaches monogamy does not seem to hold up to even a cursory review of what the Hebrew Bible has to say about polygamy. Indeed, in a roundabout way, this might explain why Nephi (the precedingâ€”and firstâ€”narrator of the Book of Mormon story) never mentions a command against polygamy, despite Jacob's insistence to his audience that "these commandments were given to our father Lehi; wherefore you have known them before" (Jacob 2:44; LDS 2:34). If Laman and Lemuel's desire for polygamy had inspired Lehi's instruction, Nephiâ€”always eager to criticize his older brothersâ€”likely would have brought it up. However, Jacob is clear that the Lamanites are committed monogamists. Salleh and Olsen Hemming[^5] provide alternative inspiration for Lehi's instruction, noting that Jacob's sermon actually suggests that it was polygamy (and women's sexual oppression more broadly) in Jerusalem that directly led to Lehi's exodus. Yet, the inhabitants of Jerusalem are also a favorite target of Nephi, which only makes this omission all the more curious. 

Perhaps Nephi didn't include the commandment because it made him look badâ€”was he more inclined to agree with the scriptures than his father on the subject of polygamy? Grant Hardy[^21] has suggested that Nephi's record may intentionally leave out awkward encounters with his father. Note, for example, that Lehi has nothing to say about Nephi's slaying of Labanâ€”not even to reassure him that it was the right choice. Likewise, Nephi records Lehi's final words to all the men of his generation except himself, which seems like a major gap. Hardy also uses context clues[^31] to raise the possibility that Nephi's children were all daughters. Could the first protagonist of the Book of Mormon have been frustrated by an absence of sons and sought (like Henry VIII) to fix the problem with additional wives, only to be embarassingly rebuked by his father? This would explain the absence of Lehi's command from the narrative until Jacob is forced to bring it up a generation later. 

[^31]: In particular: Nephi's anointing of "a man" (Jacob 1:9; LDS 1:9) rather than an explicit son to be the next king, the insistence that the new kings be named after Nephi, and the disappearance of Sam (or any "Samites") from the Book of Mormon narrative after Nephi dies. Hardy also raises the possibility of Nephi's sons dying early in life or joining Laman and Lemuel; my reading would make this unlikely, since Nephi's frustration at a lack of sons would have been before his father's death.

Indeed, it could also explain why Jacob was forced to bring it up in the first place. If rumors flowed that Nephiâ€”the first prophet and monarch of this peopleâ€”sometimes privately wondered whether polygamy was really all that bad (after all, it's not condemned by the Hebrew Bible!), future Nephites might wonder the same thing[^32]. In short, as Jacob channels his father in preaching against polygamy, I read him as having to deal with the precedent of scripture *and* the precedent of his older brother's semi-private musings. For all of Jacob's insistence that scripture is clear on this matter (he is perhaps less willing to openly criticize his brother), I read him as knowing that things aren't as straightforward as that.

[^32]: This is off-topic for this essay, but I see a parallel here to LDS Church president Ezra Taft Benson, who had strong far-right sympathies. Though he eventually stopped expressing those views in public, those views were never repudiated, allowing them to survive (and, in some corners, flourish) within Mormonism. See, for example:

	Harris, M. L. (2020). *Watchman on the Tower: Ezra Taft Benson and the Making of the Mormon Right*. Salt Lake City: The University of Utah Press.

### ...But Is Jacob Right?

> "Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ"
> 
> Jacob 5:19 [LDS 2:23]

Yet, I don't think that Jacob is dishonest either. I read Jacob as an aggressive reinterpreter of scripture, and if I sometimes find his approach *too* aggressive, I appreciate his intentions. Although they do not touch on sexual ethics, Jacob's other appearances in the Book of Mormon also illustrate his approach of aggressive reinterpretation. This is perhaps most evident when Jacob faces off against a man named Sherem. Sherem accuses Jacob of "convert[ing] the law of Moses into the worship of a being, which you say shall come many hundred years since" (Jacob 5:10; LDS 7:7)â€”in other words, Sherem argues that there is no sure evidence for the future ministry of Jesus Christ in the Hebrew Bible. Jacob responds to Sherem that the scriptures "truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ" (Jacob 5:18-19; LDS 7:11)

Once again, however, scripture does not seem to support Jacob's claims. Like the example of Matthew 1:22-23 and Isaiah 7:14 addressed earlier, there is no inherent harm in Jacob (or any other Christian) finding Jesus in the text of the Hebrew Bible; however, responsible interpretation of scripture must acknowledge that each passage recognized by Christians as prophecy of the central figure of their faith also serves other specific, non-Christian purposes within the context of that passage. In short, Christians may find additional meaning in these scriptures, but there is no justification for insisting that others recognize and adopt that same meaning. Read in this light, Jacob's belligerence toward Sherem (not to mention his calling down the power of God in a way that leads to Sherem's death) is troubling indeed! Although it is necessary that we wrestle with that storyâ€”and its problematic promotion of supersessionism[^33]â€”I will not do so here[^34]. Rather, for the purposes of this essay, Jacob's conflict with Sherem serves to emphasize that Jacob is willing to read to read his theological commitments into scripture even when the text itself does not originally contain those commitments.

[^33]:  Wayment[^16] describes supersessionism as a belief that "the law of Moses has been superseded or replaced in its entirety by the gospel or new covenant." This belief facilitates "the persecutition of marginalization of Jews because they had been effectively been replaced in God's covenant" (p. 330). As Wayment points out, members of Restoration denominations "have tended to be stronger in their supersessionist views" (p. 330), and the Book of Mormon (including through passages in Jacob) has provided support for that tendency. If I read the Book of Mormon because it strengthens my Christian convictions, I also reject any reading of it that contributes to supersessionism.

[^34]: Nonetheless, as a starting point, I recommend the essays in the following open access collection (especially those by Jana Riess and Adam Miller, which emphasize the troubling ambiguities in Jacob's account):

Also relevant here is Jacob's sermon in II Nephi 5-7 (LDS 2 Nephi 6-10). In particular, in II Nephi 6:59 (LDS 9:28), Jacob criticizes the learned who "think they are wise, and they hearken not to the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves." This passage has often been used (in LDS circles, at least[^35]) to promote a kind of moderate anti-intellectualism that insists that believers value scriptural claims over academic or scientific arguments. However, the  context of this passage suggests another interpretationâ€”one that is consistent with what we have already seen about Jacob's approach to scripture. 

[^35]: For references to 2 Nephi 9 in LDS sermons, see the [BYU Scripture Citation Index](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#::c0ce09).

Grant Hardy notes[^36] that this passage appears in the context of a list of "ten woes" that Jacob pronounces as part of his sermon. Jacob's criticism of the learned does not itself contain the word "woe," so if the "ten woes" make up the rhetorical structure of this part of his sermon, the criticism must be understood in the context of the previous "woe" statement, which reads as follows: "woe to him that has the law given, that has all the commandments of God, like us, and that transgresses them, and that wastes the days of his probation" (II Nephi 6:56; LDS 2 Nephi 9:27).

Based on this connection, we know that the "learned" whom Jacob critiques has access to all of the law and commandments of God. I therefore argue that Jacob is not critiquing academic or scientific learning but rather a rigid scriptural learning that prevents the believer from "hearken[ing]... to the counsel of God," which contains new understandings for new contexts. In short, this is another argument by Jacob that we must be willing to reinterpret scripture through what God is telling us nowâ€”and a criticism of those who hold tightly to scripture to limit what God can tell us in the present moment.

## The Sexual Ethic of Jacob's Sermon

> For, behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrows, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people... because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands. 
> 
> (Jacob 2:40; LDS 2:31)

Understanding Jacob's approach to scripture helps us better understand the sexual ethic that he lays out in the remainder of his temple sermon. As I noted at the beginning of this essay, Jacob's sexual ethic has typically been understood in terms of a general call to chastity as well as a specific call to monogamy. In this section, I will suggest that this is a superficial interpretation of Jacob's sexual ethic that is accurate but does not take into account the way that it is dependent on both a deeper set of values and a single, specific context. I will then describe how acknowledging the deeper set of values can allow readers of the Book of Mormon to more thoroughly consider sexual ethics across a wider set of contexts. 

### Jacob's Superficial, Particular Sexual Ethic

A superficial interpretation of Jacob's sexual ethic simply emphasizes that God wants Nephites to commit to chastity and polygamyâ€”and elevates that teaching to a general rule. There is no denying that Jacob's sermon does mandate such a commitment. However, it must be noted that it is one of three main claims about sexual ethics in this portion of his sermon:

1. that the "wounded[ness]" (Jacob 2:9 [in both editions]) and "broken... hearts" (Jacob 2:46; LDS 2:35) of Nephite women (because of their husbands' sexual practices) are of great concern to God,
1. that the Nephite husband's wounding and breaking of hearts is not justified by scripture, and
1. that God *therefore* wants the Nephites to commit to chastity and monogamy.

Although I implicitly criticize this emphasis on chastity and monogamy by describing it as the *superficial* approach to Jacob's sexual ethic, it is important to note that it is the right and proper conclusion of Jacob's deeper values in this context. In Jacob's account, the Nephite men are flush with riches and status and are eager to turn this privilege into greater access to sexual partners. Jacob tells us that Nephite women are wounded and broken hearted because of their husbands' behavior and that those husbands have defensively turned to the scriptures to justify their actions. Jacob is indisputably right to condemn the infidelity and polygamy of the Nephite men. 

Indeed, there are other contexts in which these same values would lead to similar conclusions. Speaking broadly, I can imagine no situation in which scripture would justify a partner engaging in sexual behavior (whether within or outside an established relationship) that would wound or break the heart of someone to whom they are committed. More specifically, it seems to me unlikely that 19th century scriptural (or prophetic) encouragement of men to take additional wives would pass the test of Jacob's sexual ethic. Indeed, Emma was the first of many wives who would be wounded by this practice. In arguing for a deeper consideration of Jacob's sexual ethic, I am certainly not arguing that Jacob's call to chastity and monogamy is inappropriate in this context or that it cannot be appropriate in other contexts.

### Jacob's Deeper, General Sexual Ethic

Rather, I wish to emphasize what I see as the core of Jacob's sexual ethic, one that builds on the first two claims I identified in the last section to argue that *you cannot turn to scripture to justify a sexual ethic that wounds and breaks the hearts of others*[^37]. Thus, while Jacob's generic call to chastity and monogamy is appropriate for its context, it is important to recognize that it is a contextual response to this more foundational ethic. As Book of Mormon readers consider sexual ethics in other contexts, Jacob's surface-level argument is less valuable to us than his deeper, more general ethic.

[^37]: Although I'm putting a lot of emphasis on woundedness and broken hearts here, and although I believe that they are a core part of Jacob's sexual ethic, it also seems clear to me that they cannot be the sole consideration. To consider an obvious example, a abused spouse may feel genuinely wounded by a friend's scripture-informed advice that they should divorce their abuser, but that does not make the advice any less valid. I do not address them in this essay, but I do believe there are other valid values that must also be considered.
