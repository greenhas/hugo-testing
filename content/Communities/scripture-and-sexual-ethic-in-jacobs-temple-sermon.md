This is a piece that I've literally been meaning to write for years; the best I've gotten before is a Twitter thread or two, but I've always been meaning to come back to it and really write something out. A recent conversation with Elray Henriksen encouraged me to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) and finally get something completed. I've toyed around with the idea of submitting it for publication, and I may yet do so in the future, but for the moment, my priority is getting it done and out there. (In that same vein, I'm using a hacked-together blend of APA and Markdown footnotes for this; it's not a real citation style, but it's what came most naturally). 

## Introduction

> "For, behold, thus says the Lord, 'This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures; for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms because of the things which were written concerning David and Solomon his son.'"

> Jacob 2:32 [LDS 2:23][^1]

[^1]: Throughout this essay, my quotes and verse numbers will come from Community of Christ's 1966 *Revised Authorized Version*. This reflects my current denominational affiliation, [my belief in the value of a modern-language edition](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/tags/rereading-the-book-of-mormon-project/) of the Book of Mormon (though the RAV is very conservative in its modernization), and my agreement with a number of writers on the Book of Mormon that there is value in respecting the original chapter divisions of the Book of Mormon (which survive in Community of Christ editions but have been replaced by shorter chapters in LDS editions).

Someone turning to the Book of Mormon to develop a sexual ethic would likely consult the sermon given by the Nephite prophet Jacob in the second chapter of the book bearing his name[^2]. Indeed, LDS and RLDS figures have often referred to Jacob 2 when making arguments about the nature of sexual ethics. For example, Jacob's teaching that God delights "in the chastity of women" (2:36; LDS 2:28) was cited by LDS apostle Mark E. Petersen [in a 1969 address](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#0cf0228:t694$25858:c0cf0228) entitled *The Dangers of the So-called Sex Revolution*. Likewise, Jacob's condemnation of polygamy has been a favorite resource for RLDS critics of not only 19th century LDS polygamy but also their own church's 20th century policies (and, with D&C 150, scripture) allowing polygamous men to be baptized so long as they committed to take no more wives[^3].

[^2]: Conveniently, Jacob's temple sermon appears in Jacob 2 for both LDS and Community of Christ readers.

Yet, careful readings of Jacob's temple sermon suggest that its sexual ethic is more nuanced than a generic call to chastity (or even a simple condemnation of polygamy). For example, a number of writers have found feminist themes in Jacob's sermon. Carol Lynn Pearson[^4] points to the polygamous husbands of this passage as one piece of evidence (among many others) of an "anti-female bias evident among the Nephites" that may have been "one of the numerous causes of their downfall" (p. 223). Similarly, Deidre Nicole Green[^5] interprets "Jacob's references to women's chastity" as a reference "to women's sexual agency" (p. 88), and Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming[^6] describe Jacob's sermon as containing "some of the most overtly feminist messages of the Book of Mormon" (p. 111). These readings invite us to see Jacob's sexual ethic as the consequence of a deeper commitment to gender equality rather than a self-evident list of sexual prohibitions.

Inspired by these kinds of readings, my goal in this essay is to offer further nuance to Jacob's
