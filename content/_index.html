<p>Hello! My name is Spencer Greenhalgh, and this website is the core of my online presence. To combat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse">context collapse</a>, I've divided this website into multiple sections. Chances are that most visitors to this website are mainly interested in one of those sections!<p>

<p>You can find posts and pages about my personal interests and projects at <a href="/myself">Myself</a>, about family life and friendships at <a href="/relationships">Relationships</a>, about my teaching and research at <a href="/work">Work</a>, and about politics and religion at <a href="/communities">Communities</a>.</p>

<p> I am also present other places online (usually as forwards of posts here), which you can learn more about through the social icons in the page header. In particular, I have four Mastodon accounts that also correspond to <a rel="me" href="https://tooting.ch/@spgreenhalgh">Myself</a>), <a rel="me" href="https://dads.cool/@spgreenhalgh">Relationships</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://scholar.social/@spgreenhalgh">Work</a> and <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@spgreenhalgh">Communities</a>. While I personally recommend RSS for keeping up with my content (you can subscribe to a number of custom feeds <a href="https://spencergreenhalgh.com/rss/">here</a>), all content also goes to at least one of those Mastodon accounts.</p>
