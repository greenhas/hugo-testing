<p>Hello! My name is Spencer Greenhalgh, and this website is the core of my online presence. To combat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse">context collapse</a>, I've divided this website into multiple sections. Chances are that most visitors to this website are mainly interested in one of those sections!<p>

<p>You can find posts and pages about my personal interests and projects at <a href="/myself">Myself</a>, about family life and friendships at <a href="/relationships">Relationships</a>, about my teaching and research at <a href="/work">Work</a>, and about politics and religion at <a href="/communities">Communities</a>. You can also bring up all long-form blog posts <a href="/tags/macro">here</a>, all microblog posts <a href="/tags/micro">here</a>, and all linkblogging <a href="/tags/link">here</a>.</p>

<p>The social icons in the page header link to other places where I am present online, means of subscribing to the content on this website, or ways of interacting with this website. I can also be contacted with professional queries at spencer [dot] greenhalgh [at] uky [dot] edu.</p>
