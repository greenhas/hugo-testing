<p>For those who don't use RSS, Micro.blog, or Mastodon, I offer a <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> newsletter that provides a weekly(ish?) digest of the content that I post here.</a></p> 

<p>I ultimately chose Buttondown because I didn't want subscribers (or myself!) getting tracked, and this platform seems to have a solid approach to privacy protection. However, that also meant giving up on some other features I would have liked; in short, I have to personally send out each email (and might forget!), and I can only offer a single newsletter that encompasses all four miniblogs. To get around these issues, you could use a service like <a href="https://ifttt.com/email">IFTTT</a> or <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/email/integrations/rss/1441/send-new-rss-feed-entries-via-email">Zapier to receive all entries in a particular RSS feed via email, but that takes some more work on your part.</p>

<p>So, despite its downsides, this Buttondown newsletter is definitely the quickest and easiest way to follow what I'm writing here by email!</p>
