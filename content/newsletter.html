<p>For those who don't use RSS, Micro.blog, or Mastodon, I offer a <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> newsletter that provides a weekly(ish?) digest of the content that I post here.</p> 

<p>I ultimately chose Buttondown because I didn't want subscribers (or myself!) getting tracked, and this platform seems to have a solid approach to privacy protection. However, that also meant giving up on some other features I would have liked; in short, I have to personally send out each email (and might forget!), and I can only offer a single newsletter that encompasses all four miniblogs.</p>

<p>Gripes aside, this is a quick and easy way to follow what I'm writing here!</p>
