Although Hugo works with a number of [commenting systems](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/), I've chosen to use the social annotation software Hypothesis as the social layer on this website. 

When you open any blog post, you'll automatically see a three-button interface appear in the top right of your browser window. Clicking on the top `<` button will open up a sidebar that will allow you to see existing comments on the text of the post (which will also be indicated as highlights in the post). If you sign in with (or create) a Hypothesis account, you'll also be able to add your own comments.

I regularly check in on [comments for this website](https://hypothes.is/search?q=url%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fspencergreenhalgh.com%2F*) and will generally respond!
