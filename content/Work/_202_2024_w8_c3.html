# take a picture of the ports on your computer

---

class: center, middle

# using what you've learned from Chapter 10, identify each type of port that's available on your computer

## (some ports weren't covered in Chapter 10, so I'll be less picky here)

# create a Google Slides deck, one slide per type of port

---

class: center, middle

# on each slide, include the following:

## arrows to point out the port you're identifying on that slide
## an explanation of what that port is and what it does
## a description of the technology behind the port and the capabilities of that technology (be specific)
## the name of at least one peripheral that you would reasonably expect to be compatible with that port

# "On my iPhone there is a feature called 'voiceover' that will read aloud everything you touch on your screen. Tapping once on something prompts the phone to read it. Double tapping is how you interact with the it and select or press. This allows you to fully use the phone without seeing it."

# "One of the accessibility options I found for replacing the standard touchscreen keyboard on my phone is the text-to-speech dictation mode that there iPhone offers."

# "One modern peripheral that I have seen for an accessibility feature is foot pedals for a gamer that has no hands. He straps his wrist to the mouse and uses his feet on the foot pedals for left and right clicks."

# "Second, I feel like the most used accessibility feature to replace input and output are speech recognition, where you speak and the device types for you and screen readers where the device reads the screen out for you."

# "Among other display options, the colors can be inverted, text can be made bigger, the contrast can be adjusted, motion and transparency of GUI items can be turned off, and the user can filter the colors that the display outputs, in order to remove colors that may interfere with their vision, or colors that are hard to see and may impede the user experience with the machine."
