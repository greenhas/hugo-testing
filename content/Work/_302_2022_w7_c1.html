# what is a channel? 

--

> *A distribution outlet for content; a method in which content is consumed.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/channel/)

--

* what content do you consume?

--

* which channels is it available through?

---

# why think about channels?

--

> *A tale as old as time: if all you have is a hammer, all you see are nails.*

Griff

--

> *websites themselves are a translation of media into the web format*

Whitman Joyner

--

> *Its interesting to think about SMS texts such as Remind as content*

Ethan Johnson

---

# channel preferences

--

> *Most people (including myself) prefer to have important news and information pushed to me rather than having to check at irregular intervals for website updates to hunt for new announcements and information.*

Jared Hyde

--

> *Nowadays social media has become the primary destination for consuming content, if I see a certain portion of a content floating in the social media then only I prefer surfing information in the actual website.*

Kusmira Pandey

---

# how many channels to target?

--

> *The biggest reason to manage content across multiple channels is to reach a wider audience. Some people may not use Facebook but might use Twitter, so managing content through both will reach both users.*

Taylor Biggs

--

> *An organization might decide on which channels to work with or not based on the demographic of the set network*

Jared's links to [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/), [Twitter](https://www.statista.com/statistics/283119/age-distribution-of-global-twitter-users/), and [TikTok](https://wallaroomedia.com/wp-content/w3-webp/uploads/2020/08/tiktok-users-by-age.pngw3.webp) demographics.

--

> *However, I think some contrast to what she describes versus a previous interview with Catherine from the Information and Communication school is the use of spraying your content everywhere for mass consumption, versus just targeting your audience.*

# multichannel distribution

--

> *Systems that can publish content to more than one channel are called multi-channel.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/channel/)

--

have any of you worked with multichannel systems? can you think of any examples?

--

> *Applications like Buffer can help with this problem by allowing the user to pre-write and schedule content releases across multiple platforms.*

Sophia Medley

--

WordPress features and plug-ins can help with this!

# multichannel distribution

--

> *let’s consider for a minute all the things that could happen with that content. Assume, for this discussion, that this piece of content is about the north parking lot being closed on Friday for re-surfacing.*

Deane Barker, [Beyond Web-Centricity in Content Management](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/beyond-web-centricity-in-content-management/)

---

> *It could…*

> *appear on the intranet.*

>  *be emailed to an internal mailing list.*

>  *be syndicated in an RSS feed.*

>  *be emailed to a third-party (the contractor, perhaps?)*

>  *be posted to an internal calendar.*

>  *be published in a department’s print newsletter.*

>  *appear on various LCD TVs around the building.*

>  *appear in other system – an interstitial login window (“Important Announcements!”) when customer services reps sign in, for instance.*

>  *be transmitted to other parties via a Web service or other method (press releases go to PRNewswire or something)*

>  *be sent to mobile devices via SMS.*

# platforms, channels, and interoperability

--

> *The bigger problem is that they’ve abandoned interoperability. RSS, semantic markup, microformats, and open APIs all enable interoperability, but the big players don’t want that — they want to lock you in, shut out competitors, and make a service so proprietary that even if you could get your data out, it would be either useless (no alternatives to import into) or cripplingly lonely (empty social networks).*

Marco Arment, [Lockdown](https://marco.org/2013/07/03/lockdown)

--

> *Most of the creators are from youtube and the main reason they made nebula was for greater control over their content and better pay. The only problem is that nebula is much less popular than youtube and the battle to get more popular is very uphill.*

# what are examples of closed channels? open channels?

---

> *When Spotify decided to try to become the biggest podcasting platform in the world, it knew it needed a nuclear weapon: Joe Rogan.*

Ashley Carman, [Joe Rogan, Confined to Spotify, Is Losing Influence](https://www.theverge.com/22632213/joe-rogan-experience-spotify-exclusive-audience-reach)

--

> *However, a new data investigation by The Verge finds that the powerful podcaster’s influence has waned since he went behind Spotify’s wall. His show has declined as a hype vehicle for guests, and Rogan’s presence as a mainstay in the news has plummeted.*

--

> *The show used to benefit from posting full episodes to YouTube, which usually received millions of views each and often led to snippets going viral on other platforms, like Twitter. But the YouTube channel now just hosts clips, which don’t always break the million-view milestone. Rogan also used to have visibility in other podcasting apps, which is important because not everyone uses Spotify. It’s possible that social media algorithms, and YouTube’s in particular, also helped Rogan and his guests gain a following.*

# looking ahead to content and presentation

--

> *Personally for myself and the job that I work at I sometimes help make social media posts and not every platform works with every size flyer or image and sometimes you have to edit them in a specific way to make it work best for the platform you are trying to use. *

Michael Kinser

--

> *The difference being pointed out here between content and presentation is really interesting to me, I previously assumed they were a lot more similar.*

Sophia Medley

--

> *Content can be applied to many different platforms and different mediums, so Barker believes it is important to ignore these constraints and just create content, not web content, or magazine content, or TV content.*
