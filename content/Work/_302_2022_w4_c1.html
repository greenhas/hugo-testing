## it makes sense to define an A as "get all the things done," but...

## what are "the things"? 

--

## between now and the mid-semester contract update (sooner = better), work on defining "the things"

# what is content management?

---

# content management

--

> *A wide-ranging term that generally refers to the practice of defining, creating, organizing, securing, reviewing, approving, publishing, and delivering content.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content-management/)

--

> *I think one of the main takeaways is there are so many moving parts that go into creating content. Even if it may seem like a simple doing, there was time and money that went into providing it.*

# who is involved in content management?

---
# roles in content management

--

> *Madeline talks about writers, editors, and project managers being the main roles for a content creation team.  The writer creates the content and then sends the info to the editors in order to refine the product. The project manager makes sure everything is organized and on time. There is a single person who interacts with the client, so there is no confusion between the members and everyone is on the same page.*

Taylor Biggs

--

> *There is of course the business with need for content, those producing or reviewing the content on behalf of the business, and any intermediaries. She mentioned that she's only involved with the creation of content, but doesn't have any involvement with and perhaps isn't likely to see what happens to it subsequent to that phase.*

Jared Hyde

--

> *I am sure the client side has teams that will review the content and have people that confirms it is good enough or not good enough.*

Britt Strong

# roles in content management

> *There simply is no single skill of “cooking.” If you say, “I can cook!” what are you saying? It’s not like you stand there and then just…cook. It’s not binary like you’re just “cooking” or “not cooking.”*

# roles in content management

--
five roles in Barker's *Web Content Management*:
* editors
* site planners
* developers 
* administrators
* stakeholders

--

# 🎩🧢👒🎓

--

> *The roles from teams could spread from one person to a office full people.*

Zach Schell

---

# editors

--

> *A CMS user responsible for performing editorial process to create, edit, or otherwise manage content. An editor creates, manages, edits, approves, and publishes content. This is considered the core user of a CMS. Most CMS functionality is based around editors.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/editor/)

--

### subtypes:

* power editor
* approver
* community manager / content moderator
* marketer

---

# editors

--

> *Editing is crucial for many things including movies, YouTube videos, papers, and more.*

Britt Strong

--

> *They seemed to almost redo the entire movie, especially the ending which surprised me a lot. As*

Michael Kinser

---

# site planners

--

> *Site planners are responsible for designing the website the CMS will manage. Most of their involvement will be prior to launch, with sporadic further involvement as the site develops and changes over time.* 

Deane Barker, *Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices*, p. 56

--

> *This just goes to show that the way you present your content is almost as important as the content itself*

Jacob Hunt

---

# developers

--

> *The role responsible for installing, configuring, extending, and templating a CMS implementation.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/developer/)

--

### subtypes:

* front-end developers (work with HTML/CSS and templates)
* back-end developers (work with the CMS itself and extensions)

--

> *I could imagine that you have people behind the scenes who are doing other things in the company such as simple IT guys to keep their system up and running.*

Joseph Schrodowski

---

# administrator

--

> *A role responsible for managing the settings, users, permissions, and other configurable functionality of a CMS. This role manages the system itself, not the content within it.*

--

> *The person in the administrator role is often also a power editor, and occasionally one of the implementing developers.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/administrator/)

--

another take on administrator: 

--

> *This process of allowing the Project Manager to lead this group, this will allow client to have one main person as the representative. *

Gin Grizzell-Justice

---

# stakeholder

--

> *A role which does not interact directly with the CMS but is primarily concerned with the results the CMS is intended to bring about.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/stakeholder/)

---
# workflow

--

> *An framework to move content through a defined set or map of specific steps, activities, or tasks.*

--

> *The content can only be “in” one such state for a particular workflow at a time. When that state resolves, content will “move” to another state, and continue until the workflow ends.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/workflow/)

--

what did the Star Wars workflow look like? 

--

> *As said in the video, "a film is made three times: on the page, on set, and in the edit."*

Sophia Medley

--

what did Madeline's workflow look like?

--

other examples?

---

# workflow helps

--

> *They also use project management software, first Asana, and now Basecamp.*

Caleb Faris

--

> *Madeline mentioned initially they used Asana, but the less capability of communicating with each other, and organizing work for clients made them switch to basecamps.*

Kusmira Pandey

--

> *There will be a spreadsheet system that is shared with management teams and the clientele, the content calendar.*

Aaliyah Grider

---

# importance of workflow

--

> Organization and cohesion seems to be the key parts for successful content creation, without proper cohesion and organization for a project and team standards and requirements run the risk of being lost and/or lowered, leading to a poorer quality of the end product.

Chris Frondal

--

> *It sounds like there is a lot of back and forth and trying to keep everyone in the loop from a technical side as well as keeping communications simplistic enough so that someone who isnt well versed in the field can be kept in the information loop.*

Mathea Kumic

--

> *This process works largely by avoiding complicated bureaucracy in order to streamline communication by having as few people involved as possible. *

# when workflow goes wrong!

November 17, 2020 *New York Times* [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/world/europe/france-website-obituaries.html) by Aurelien Breeden: 

--

> *For a brief moment this week, startled readers of a French news site had to grapple with the apparent demise of Queen Elizabeth II of England; Pelé, the Brazilian soccer legend; Clint Eastwood; Brigitte Bardot; and dozens of other celebrities and world leaders.*

--

> *As it turned out, the website of Radio France Internationale had mistakenly published about 100 prewritten obituaries for prominent figures.*

--

> *Several hours after the obituaries first ran on Monday, the public radio station, which broadcasts in France and abroad, apologized and started taking the reports offline. It said unedited drafts had been accidentally published as it moved its website to a new content management system. Online platforms like Google and Yahoo News then automatically picked up some of the articles.*

February 28, 2022 *The Scotsman* [story](https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/russian-news-agency-appears-to-accidentally-publish-article-claiming-victory-3590253): 

--

> *It is the blunder feared by every news outlet that has pre-prepared articles written in the event of a sudden breaking story.*

--

> *For Russian state-run news agency RIA-Novosti, the error was arguably worse than many similar bloopers, when it published a comment piece [two days after the invasion] proclaiming Russian victory in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.*
