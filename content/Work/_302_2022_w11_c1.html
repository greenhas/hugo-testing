# how have you been able to customize your CMS so far? 

---

# CMS extension

--

> *The customization of a CMS is accomplished on two levels*

Deane Barker, *Web Content Management*, p. 235

--

> *There's templating [and presentation], which is fully expected...*

--

> *Then there are deeper customizations to change or add to the operation of the CMS itself*

--

let's look at our [class WordPress setup](http://159.89.226.20/wp-admin/)

# extension

---

# extensibility model

--

> *The collection of processes, services, tools, and APIs that can be used to extend a CMS.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel CMS Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/extensibility-model/)

--

## what's an API?

--

> *The language tools available for developers to communicate with and control software from code.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel CMS Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/application-programming-interface/)

--
## API examples

--

[MarsEdit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/) WordPress client for macOS

--

[WordPress APIs](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_APIs)

---

# Plugin (or Extension or Add-On or...)

--

> *An extension to a CMS which is packaged for distribution and installation into other instances of the CMS.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel CMS Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/plug-in/)

--

## how is this different than an API?

--

> *The ecosystem of a particular CMS often generates plug-ins for their system and maintains a common repository.*

# problems with plug-ins

# security

--

> *Is this also an issue with open source software like we've mentioned before?*

Mathea Kumic

--

> *Why wouldn't the schools run a hacking test to see if something like this was possible before giving it access to student information.*

Whitman Joyner

--

> *hide it in other, more harmless code* 

Taylor Biggs

---

# maintainability

--

> *When a software gets upgraded or in this case a plugin gets updated many do not like updates as they are fearful of losing data or losing the method of how they used this before.*

Zach Talley

--

> *This has happened to me and it can be super frustrating as these are helpful extensions that I have on my computer to make things easier and then they are gone because they are not supported anymore.*

Michael Kinser

--

> *Since our group uses a plugin for our forums, if this extension is no longer supported, we lose a major element of our site*

Taylor Biggs

--

> *How common is it for users to lose functionality after an upgrade?*

Aaliyah Grider

---

# when the plugin (not the software) becomes dominant

--

> *There is some kind of extension majority of people use and everyttime tumblr pushes out an aweful update, users just wait for that plugin/extension to be updated so that it functions more like older version and has the features and accessibilty they like*

Mathea Kumic

--

> *What the developers make themselves ends up maybe not being supported on the next version of the software that the plugin is running on, but they still have to take the blame*

Joseph Schodrowski

--

> *Usually an OS update offers more features and better security. It should not be Microsoft's responsibility to build their system around others. *

# consistency

---

class: center, middle

# you can't avoid plugins, but try anyway

---

class: center, middle

*A question I have had before is at what point are plugins more of a hassle then just making it "in house".*

Ethan Johnson

---

class: center, middle

*Some softwares/plugins can allow for users to feel that their data is trapped unless they pay that subscription or that they keep using that certain plug as their content was built using that specific plug in.*

Zach Talley

---

class: center, middle

*Some functions should be ideally partnered with the Platform to maintain that relationship. If a plugin or extension is seen as necessary then they should be recognized as such.*

Zach Schell

*At this point, if a plugin is used by a majority of the user base and provides a critical function why not just integrate it.*
