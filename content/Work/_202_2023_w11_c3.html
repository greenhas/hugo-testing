# "Like for previous assessment activities, you're going to submit a Google Slides deck with some screenshots showing what you did and how it relates to the readings. Unlike previous activities, though, I'm going to leave most of this up to you."

# "There's one screenshot I will specifically ask you to take at the end of the process, but you should take another three screenshots as you follow the directions below. Ideally, each screenshot will represent an 'ah-ha!' moment you had—I'm intentionally not explaining the significance of all the steps below, but most of them relate specifically to what you've read in this module's readings."

# "This week, Phia wonders what kind of person falls for phishing attacks. Is it only insanely gullible luddites, or can smart, tech savvy people get phished, too? To find out, she conducts an experiment on her poor, unsuspecting coworkers."

## "PHIA: Blumberg felt about it the way I did. Phishing is for dummies. But then a month later, news came out that the President of France, his campaign got phished, like some of his staffers ended up handing over their personal passwords. And actually, I started to notice that a lot of the hacks that I’m reading about recently, they start with phishing—John Podesta, that was phishing, the Sony hack by North Korea—that was phishing."

# "PHIA: He shows me the email and it's crazy because it completely looks like it's coming from me. Like, it looks like it's coming from phia@gimletmedia.com. But, obviously I didn't send it."

# "PHIA: And, when you put in your username and your password on his page, he just immediately forwarded that to a real Gmail login. And from there, because he put in your username and password, a two-factor code was texted to you. "

# The most impressive technique in my opinion was they used a server near where the person that was the target of the phishing attack. 

Matt Coomer

# "And the server he was using was actually based in New York, so if you check where you’ve recently signed into Gmail, it will show a New York-based location, which is what Daniel says, they would really do if it was a targeted phishing attempt."
