# updates

--

* don't forget to annotate (but let me know if I miss something)

--

* make sure you have notifications turned on for assignment comments; that's how I'll communicate with you about reports, etc.

--

* details are more important than length

--

* check your links! please link to your specific post on Netlify, not to the overall site or to a file on GitHub

--

* pay attention to how [Markdown works](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/hugo/) (including spaces); Hugo [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) is also helpful

--

* setting up communication/collaboration spaces is good—we'll do more of this formally next week

--

* connect to one of the "I Can" statements—and make it obvious

--

* **prove**, don't just **describe**

---

# running down the "I Can" statements

### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

### I can describe and compare content management systems

### I can manage content using established workflows

### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

# catching up on the content model tinkering activity

--

* (part of) the Hugo content model: [example one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenhas/spg_website/master/content/Relationships/2022-09-04-If-there.md), [example two](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenhas/spg_website/master/content/Work/classdojo-and-the-creation-of-artificial-demand.md)

--

* your post for a tinkering activity should tell me:

--

    * what you did during the activity
    
--

    * how that activity relates back to the subject for that week

# content and mission

--

## what is the mission of your hypothetical organization?

--

## what is the relationship between content and that mission?

---

# Catherine Hayden interview: what is content?

--

> *The kinds of content that Catherine produces for the school are stories and considers herself a storyteller.*

Becca Araiza

--

> *Calling the type of content for the college of CI 'stories' makes quite a bit of sense for the communication part the college...*

Chris Frondal

---

# Catherine Hayden interview: content and mission

--

> *Instead of someone else writing stories about the college, she wants to write the stories and share them through various mediums.*

Kusmira Pandey

--

> *The common line connecting this diverse target audience is that they all are essential in fulfilling the primary goal of the college's content - to attract new students to the program.*

Sophia Medley

--

> *Content produced by the college supports the college by bringing donations to the school, notice to the college from the public, as well as being an active media to inform people what's happening at the College from people who are there.*

Zach Shell

---

# Catherine Hayden interview: content and audiences

--

> *Students, Alumni, Local media, local business, social media followers, higher management, other departments*

Whitman Joyner

--

> *she tries to avoid a "spray and pray" method when sharing content*

Caleb Faris

--

> *One thing that she mentioned which I thought was interesting because I figured that it was a given but she mentioned that each post throughout all of the content they post is thought over and has a purpose*

Michael Kinser

--

> *Theres a different level of professionalism,  different information, different needs for each group and all the different forms of content across different platforms makes that possible.*

Mathea Kumic

---

# webcomics reading: comics and the internet

--

> *Web comics are comics that people publish on the internet*

Taylor Biggs

--

> *I feel a lot people try and do this specifically with nostalgia-driven stories to get old audiences back or to try and keep people watching/reading instead of having them move on to something else.*

Michael Kinser

--

> *It’s interesting how there used to be dedicated websites for webcomics.*

Jacob Hunt

--

> *There's apparently a parallel between the social media conglomerates of today and the newspapers of the 90s.*

Jared Hyde

--

> *Social media has a way of spreading things faster than something like a blog. ... Now I notice webcomics more now than ever.*

Gin Grizzell-Justice

# webcomics reading: content updates and subscriptions

--

> *Notifications!*

Caleb Faris

--

> *Locating other webcomic creators were harder to find just by general online searches. Since social media came along they can now push content out and have followers share it.*

Gin Grizzell-Justice

--

> *It is true, some part of the content is available in Facebook, Twitter and other social media platform, and if I like the content then only I try to find the actual website*

Kusmira Pandey

--

> *Content creators are being told that they should enjoy their fifteen minutes of fame and make all the money they can before they become "irrelevant".*

Becca Araiza

---

# webcomics reading: revenue models

--

> *Some platforms pay content creators based on the views and interactions they get. i.e. Tik Tok and Youtube*

Caleb Faris

--

> *Raid shadow Legends*

Whitman Joyner (and Taylor Biggs)

--

> *This seems like the beginning of subscriptions. ' Let me pay you $20 to keep up the entertainment. I am enjoying it.'*
