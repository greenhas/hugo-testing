# conclusion and implications

???

And that, then, brings us to the end of our presentation, where we'd like to highlight some of the broader implications that we're starting to draw from our findings.

---

class: center, middle

background-color: #272822

<h1 style="color:white">is the DezNat movement self-contradicting?</h1>

???

First, is the DezNat movement cohesive? Or is it inconsistent with its own logic? On one hand, DezNat is a response to liberal Mormon Twitter accounts whom they perceive as having usurped authority thanks to the internet's flattening of authority structures. On the other hand, DezNat's own claims to religious authority are exercised through Twitter rather than through any formal process—they are, in a sense, what they are fighting against. 

In fact...

---
class: middle, center

# "Exactly how does one make sure a hashtag is regulated?"

document 312 [modified]

???

... even DezNat recognizes the absurdity of claiming that anyone who uses a Twitter hashtag is part of a cohesive, unified movement. This quote from our data is a response to a DezNat critic who argued that people were getting out of control and that the movement needed to do better about policing itself. However, the DezNat partisan's response is essentially "you can't control a hashtag." While that's true, it raises questions about DezNat's true unity, and disunity's implications for their claims to authority.

---

class: middle, center

# "DezNat is “not affiliated with or endorsed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,” church spokesman Doug Andersen said Wednesday."

Stack, P. F. (2021, January 31). Unholy war: Is #DezNat an online platform for defending the LDS Church or a launching pad for extremists? *The Salt Lake Tribune*. https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2021/01/31/unholy-war-deznat-troops/

???

Of course, this is further emphasized by a Church statement in early 2021 that DezNat should not be seen as an officially-endorsed group. Generally speaking, liberal Mormons on Twitter don't claim ecclesiastical authority for their statements, so DezNat's suggestion in our data that it did have this authority might be more like overreaching than what the movement purports to be fighting against.

<h1 style="color:white">how is religious authority defined in Latter-day Saint circles?</h1>

???

The other big question that we're coming away with is the question of how religious authority is actually defined in Latter-day Saint circles. 

DezNat participants are full-throated supporters of the Church and eager to prop up this authority, but our data suggest that they aren't entirely sure what the mechanics or the limits of that authority are.

class: center, middle

# "[LGBT] issues strike at the very heart of Mormon ideas of authority"

Riess, J. (2019). *The next Mormons: How millennials are changing the LDS church*." Oxford University Press.

???

As Jana has written, questions about authority are associated with many of the other controversies that the church is facing. Now, Jana wrote this in the context of queer Latter-day Saints deciding to leave the faith—it's difficult to believe that 15 men are wrong about LGBT issues but still speak authoritatively for God in most other contexts. However, our findings also show another way in which this relationship is true: DezNat partisans are willing to accept baby steps away from homophobia in the name of deference to religious authority but uncomfortable with the prospect of Latter-day Saint leaders taking further steps toward affirmation.
