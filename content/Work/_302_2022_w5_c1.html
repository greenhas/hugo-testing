> *Way back in the beginning, or at least the early 1990s, the Internet was made up of a bunch of websites constructed from hand-coded strands of HTML.*

Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)


--

> *When GeoCities launched in 1995, there were only a few million people on the Internet. The service provided an interface for users to more easily build and publish their sites, and it hosted domains and thematic directories—it was, in essence, one of the first freely and widely available content management systems.*

Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)

> *Typically, as a user, I never think about or care what CMS a website I visit is based on (or if they use one at all).*

# content management systems

--

> *A software system which automates the tasks around the management of content. A CMS assists editors in creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately delivering content.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/content-management-system/)

--

> *I think that using a CMS used in the right way could really help a business with pretty much everything on their website. It would make things way easier when it comes to posting content that they may need to post in the future or take down content that they had already posted.*

--

* component content management systems

--

* records management

--

* learning management systems

--

* digital asset management

# what a CMS doesn't do (see Barker's *Web Content Management*, chapter 1)

> *It makes me wonder if a good cms could put out bad content and stay afloat.*

Mathea Kumic

--

--

> > > *CMSs also increasingly influence not just how stories look but how they are produced, discovered, read, and monetized*

> > Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)

Joseph Schodrowski

# the CMS marketplace

--

> *A company might not share its CMS if they use it often and it works extremely well.*

Taylor Biggs

--

> *Security concerns are what come to mind initially. If an adversary can't even get their hands on a copy of the program they are trying to exploit, their job becomes much harder.*

Griff

--

> *I know that in the newspaper space there's a worry that rich benefactors buying up newspapers is going to lead to papers biased in favor of said benefactors. I can see a similar worry occurring when it comes to cyberspace and anti big tech news.*

Whitman Joyner

think about Amazon, the Washington Post, and the Arc CMS

# the bigger picture

--

> *the fight to control how content is distributed and how audiences are sold online, as well as who gets the money*

Kyle Chayka, [In the Shadow of the CMS](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/content-management-system-essay-wordpress-drupal-internet-feature/)

> *Facebook reportedly fielded complaints from political parties saying a major News Feed change pushed them toward negative, polarizing posts. Today, The Wall Street Journal posted leaked reports from Facebook after it boosted “meaningful social interactions” on the platform. While Facebook framed the move as helping friends connect, internal reports said it had “unhealthy side effects on important slices of public content, such as politics and news,” calling these effects an “increasing liability.”*
