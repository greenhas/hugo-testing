# why talk about CMS features?

---

class: center, middle

# I really hate CMS feature matrices. You see these in RFPs all the time – “Check the box if your CMS does X.”

> *This another example of user generated content being supported by a CMS.*

Caleb Faris

--

> *Dr. Kimmons created his own CMS to subvert the inflexibility of traditional web and print textbook publishing.*

Jared Hyde

--

> *Dr. Kimmons chose to develop his own CMS because he had such a niche need that repurposing an existing CMS would not suffice, creating a completely new one was more practical.*

> *a wide variety of users have different opinions on the addition of certain features. Theres no way of pleasing all users of a site.*

Sophia Medley

> *I feel like I would have no idea where to begin if I did not take this class in picking one to use.*

> *If you walk into a store looking for pizza they may not have the kind you like, that's not to say they don't have pizza, it just doesn't meet all of your specifications.*

# feature language gives us a way of comparing CMSs to each other

---

# feature presence is rarely binary

--

> *it is often better to view the feature as a gradient*

Caleb Faris

--

> *A feature may have several functional parts or interactions a user wants*

Mathea Kumic

--

> *if users know what they want they can go look for it, and people who dont care about it and not be confused by too much information*

Taylor Biggs

--

> *Just because the program has the capability, does not mean that it is a feature.*

# Custom and Expected Development

--

> *It seems that most CMS that we have worked with keep in mind the expected development of building something*

Ethan Johnson

--

> *Our work flow is not the same as Norton's - therefore our EPIC design, while overall looks the same, does have different features.*

Gin Grizzell-Justice

--

> *So in healthcare does each hospital use a different plugin? or a special design?*

Gin Grizzell-Justice

--

> *How ambitious of a feature does it need to be that there is no way to possibly develop a way to integrate it*
