# "As students throughout Kentucky prepare for a new school year and more remote learning amid a pandemic, the state should view internet access as a public good similar to electricity and school buses, several education and workforce leaders said Monday."

Kobin, B. (2020, August 3). As remote learning continues, leaders say Kentucky needs a 'New Deal' for internet access. *Louisville Courier Journal*, https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2020/08/03/leaders-say-kentucky-needs-new-deal-student-internet-access/5572555002/

## "'If we were to hear that a child doesn't have access to electricity in the home, we think about all of the repercussions for that and how that would impact his or her daily living and impact his or her access to the learning,' Lewis said, adding that Kentucky was the first state in the nation to ensure that all of its school districts had broadband access."

# "Reasons that internet should not be treated like electricity or water is that it is not a basic human need and can be accessible outside the home for free. You could live without internet and Wi-Fi but it would definitely make living in todays society much harder"
