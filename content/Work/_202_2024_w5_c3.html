# what computer-related obstacles did the People's Republic of China face in the 1970s?

---

class: center, middle

# Simon: The best estimates I could find say that around that time, in the entire country, with a population of nearly a billion people, there were only 3,000 computers in use.

# Tom: Why is that? Well, the simple reason is the Chinese language could not fit inside a computer.

# today, there are more than 70,000 of these Chinese characters. Each a unique visual representation of a word or an idea. The problem was, in the 1970s, computers had only a few bytes of memory. Not even enough to store a single email message.

# there wasn't enough RAM to hold all Chinese characters at the same time

# This prevented them from innovating, and growing in tech as other countries were. This was dangerous do their character system and growth of their economy.

# I think the best way to put it is that computers were the “gravediggers of Chinese characters”.

# tons of folks in the field of computing were arguing, 'We've got to replace Chinese with Esperanto or with English or with something else so that we can participate in global modernity.'

# So that when a Chinese kindergartner begins developing literacy and reading and writing, they learn Pinyin at the same time or even earlier than they start to learn Chinese characters.

Tom Mullaney in (Radiolab, 2020)

# When we use Pinyin to type, we lose sight of the Chinese characters form and the form is the soul of a character. It's like you're grabbing hold of a person and doing a way with their flesh. You can't express the meaning of a Chinese character by its sound. The more people use Pinyin, the more screwed Chinese characters are.

# [A]lthough when we think of the Chinese language, we think, oh, there's Mandarin and Cantonese. In reality, when it comes to speaking, there are dozens of different Chinese languages, Cantonese, Shanghainese, Fujianese. Languages that sound totally different, but on the page look the exact same because they're all using the same characters.

# German philosophers had this idea that the hammer isn't just a tool, the hammer actually feeds back. The hammer changes the hand. It's interesting to me that this arbitrary leftover arguably outdated QWERTY keyboard that we're all stuck with is actually influencing our preferences when it comes to naming our offspring.

# A human tradition that is perhaps more directly threatened by technological change is the common act of going to a theatre to see a movie.

# A human tradition or culture that has already been left behind is writing in cursive most younger people can not right in it except for their name and it takes them a lot longer to read cursive then it would take for them to read print.
