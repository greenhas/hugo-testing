# what computer-related obstacles did the People's Republic of China face in the 1970s?

---

class: center, middle

# Simon: The best estimates I could find say that around that time, in the entire country, with a population of nearly a billion people, there were only 3,000 computers in use.

# Tom: Why is that? Well, the simple reason is the Chinese language could not fit inside a computer.

# "the typewriter ... is designed differently and not really suitable for Chinese characters, because it's a pin that does the writing because there are so many different characters/words in the Chinese language and of course, not every "70,000" words can be fit into the typewriter."

# "today, there are more than 70,000 of these Chinese characters. Each a unique visual representation of a word or an idea. The problem was, in the 1970s, computers had only a few bytes of memory. Not even enough to store a single email message."

# why did all of this matter?

class: center, middle

# "China had to figure out a way to include all the characters to keep up with global modernity as well as become technologically advanced."

Sia Corum

# "tons of folks in the field of computing were arguing, 'We've got to replace Chinese with Esperanto or with English or with something else so that we can participate in global modernity.'"

# "So that when a Chinese kindergartner begins developing literacy and reading and writing, they learn Pinyin at the same time or even earlier than they start to learn Chinese characters."

Tom Mullaney in (Radiolab, 2020)

class: center, middle

# "When we use Pinyin to type, we lose sight of the Chinese characters form and the form is the soul of a character. It's like you're grabbing hold of a person and doing a way with their flesh. You can't express the meaning of a Chinese character by its sound. The more people use Pinyin, the more screwed Chinese characters are."

Yang Yang in (Radiolab, 2020)

# "although when we think of the Chinese language, we think, oh, there's Mandarin and Cantonese. In reality, when it comes to speaking, there are dozens of different Chinese languages, Cantonese, Shanghainese, Fujianese. Languages that sound totally different, but on the page look the exact same because they're all using the same characters."

# "German philosophers had this idea that the hammer isn't just a tool, the hammer actually feeds back. The hammer changes the hand. It's interesting to me that this arbitrary leftover arguably outdated QWERTY keyboard that we're all stuck with is actually influencing our preferences when it comes to naming our offspring."
