Okay, this has a lot more detail than the NYT article I just posted, and wow. These are pretty clear examples of plagiarism on Oxman's part, and as much as I worry about Ackman's escalation, his blustering instead of backing down when his wife is implicated in the same kind of scandal he's trying to gin up is not a great look.
