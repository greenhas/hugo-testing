# "The plethora of non-interoperable data storage formats just gets weirder when you take in other information about the IT in this universe. Data access ports remain consistent across films... But that just raises another question: why is there any interoperability across enemy lines?"

# "it's become clear to me that that the galaxy is crippled by an abundance of disk formats, with all of the accompanying interoperability issues that we see on our own planet."

# "I think the most relatable to a real life situation part is when the author talks about how Luke acted like he didn't know what was jammed in there or how to get it out."

Hudson Davis

# "'You've got something jammed in here real good,' he says to R2-D2, as though he doesn't know it's a disk. If it's a disk drive, wouldn't it obviously be a disk, and wouldn't he know to push a button to eject it?"

# what interoperability/incompatibility issues do you run into?

---

class: center, middle

# "The part of the article that I felt related the most to a real-life situation is the inability to make copies of data on the part of the Rebel forces. Even though they have the technology to make disks, they only make one disk rather than several copies, which could prove dangerous if they run into a bad situation. "

Henry Bryant

# "Seriously, could it kill them to make one more disk? Seems a little risky to go running around with a SINGLE COPY of the plans that can save the galaxy. Isn't anyone worried they're going to run into a stormtrooper with a giant magnet?"

# "I think think the idea of the Scarif facility is one of the most relatable concepts. This is because in real life many people just store stuff in the cloud now this is ideal for flexibility but what if the cloud goes down you need to have hard stored data so you dont lose important stuff."

# "ALEX: Yeah, it’s this app that, like, automatically backs up all the pictures you take on your phone or put on your computer to the cloud. It’s tagline is … hold on, let me find it, it’s tagline is, 'Forget hard drives. Give up on organizing filenames. There's a better way to find and share pictures.'"

# "RACHEL: This sounds totally like I’m a lunatic, but I’m not organized. And it really was this good feeling of, 'I am being so responsible that I am paying for this really lovely service that’s doing this amazing thing for me,' and it just worked. It just worked!"

# "ALEX: Anyway, Picturelife! So …. the problem is … that one day she goes to log into Picturelife and it’s just not working. The site is down. And it stays down for a couple of days. Like, it’s just--she can’t access it. No one can access it, it’s just gone."

# "There is no reason, aesthetically or functionally, to wear both suspenders and a belt. Not only is it unnecessary, but visually it creates the illusion of three sides of a box, cutting the line of the torso. Just wear one at a time."
