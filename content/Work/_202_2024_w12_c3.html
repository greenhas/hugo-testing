# "Unlike Google’s Android, which allows the “sideloading” of apps from outside the company’s official app store, Apple maintains a vise grip on user behavior in iOS. When Apple purged Fortnite from the App Store last year for violating its payment terms, iPhone users had no recourse."

# "Apple has, for the most part, avoided the appearance of outright malevolence—a contrast with some of its Big Tech contemporaries. But it is also, in the end, operating toward the same end goals: growth and profit. For that reason, if not others, consider well how much of your life you cede to its digital realm."
