# about ICT 202

# course policies

--

* ## this is a tough time to be in college, I'll be trying to make it less tough

--

* ## if you need help with basic needs, use [UK resources](https://uknow.uky.edu/campus-news/uk-working-ensure-food-and-housing-security-among-students)!

--

* ## breastfeeding children are always welcome in class, older children can come if childcare falls through

--

* ## our college provides lots of career readiness opportunities

---

# course policies

--

* ## I strongly discourage generative AI use in this class; you must clearly tell me if you do use it

--

* ## "We are committed to ensuring every member of our College feels welcomed, well-served, and included"

---

# my approach to ICT 202

--

* ## this course looks at the fundamentals of ICT

--

* ## I see learning as becoming a part of a community

--

* ## what does the ICT community look like? 

--

* ## we may all be headed in different directions within this community

--

* ## why are fundamentals of ICT important to know in this community?
