## "An industry standard 6250 bpi magnetic tape can hold 180 megabytes. A station wagon or light track can easily transport 200 tapes at one time. Suppose the source and destination machines are an hour's drive apart. The effective data rate between these two machines is then 288,000 megabits in 36000 sec or 80 Mbps. No wide-area network comes within an order of magnitude of this bandwidth"

## "The telescopes’ data had to go to two astronomy institutions to be processed, MIT’s Haystack Observatory in the United States and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany. An email attachment wasn’t going to work. The observatories had collected five petabytes of data. The average iPhone has 64 gigabytes of data storage. One million gigabytes are in one petabyte. It would have taken years for the data to cross the internet."

## "And so the data were carried on hundreds of hard disk drives, shipped to and from the observatories through plain old FedEx. Which is kind of marvelous, when you think about it. In a world where transferring information from one end of the world to another takes only a click, some things still have to be done the old-fashioned way."

# "I could see where the Cylons having access to the ships network would be very dangerous. If they were able to control the airlocks or doors on the ship, they could cause a lot of death and havoc."

Rylan Duvall

# "If each is an independent system, that does not communicate with the outside world, the only problems arise from those on the ship. Meanwhile, if everything is connected, and there is a connection to the outside world, then the outside world can get in."

# "For me, a downside of networked computers are that they make it so much of my information is available over the internet, so if someone really wanted to, they could get access to it without my permission."
