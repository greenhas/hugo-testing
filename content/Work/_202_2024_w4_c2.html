### biometric authentication and the Fifth Amendment

---

class: center, middle

### "In the classic paradigm, the compelled entry of a safe’s *combination* is testimonial, and thus protected against by the Fifth Amendment, because it requires the use of the contents of an individual’s mind. But generally speaking, the compelled production of a safe’s *key* is not testimonial, and is thus unprotected, because it involves a purely physical act."

Kaufman, B. M. (2017, Sep. 22). Will Apple's FaceID affect your rights? *ACLU Free Future*. https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/will-apples-faceid-affect-your-rights

---

class: center, middle

### "The judge in that case drew a bright line: Under the Fifth Amendment, police could not force the suspect to communicate his passcode, but they could force him to use his fingerprint to unlock the device. The reason? Providing a fingerprint was 'non-testimonial,' because it did not require the suspect to produce anything from his own mind."
