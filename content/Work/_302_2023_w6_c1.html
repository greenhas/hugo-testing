# content aggregation

--

> *An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/aggregation/)

--

### [content aggregation for presentation](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-edition-of-my-remixed-data-science-textbook/)

--

### [content aggregation for organization](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/tags/ict-661/)

---

# content aggregation

--

### can you think of content aggregation examples in the content that you consume?

--

### how is a podcast usually aggregated for organization?

--

### why does [Project Zion Podcast](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/) care about content aggregation?

--

### how does Project Zion Podcast aggregate their content?


---

# CMS features that support content aggregation

--

* ## menus

--

* ## categories

--

* ## tags

--

* ## other?

---

# serial

--

* ## organized "in a line"

--

* ## [Project Zion Podcast](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/episodes-quick-list/)

--


* ## [YouTube playlist/music album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYRp8oP0yiw&list=OLAK5uy_n_KoKi3ioPEsTMStsk_DIjRjvSZwBbIhg)

---

# hierarchical

--

* ## organized like a family tree, with "parent" and "child" content

--

* ## menus and categories are especially helpful here

--

* ## [Project Zion Podcast](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/series/)
    
--

* ## [Fantasy Flight Games website](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/#/universe)
    
---

# tabular

--
    
* ## organized in a table or database and then accessed through searching

--

* ## [Project Zion Podcast](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/?s=Neil+DeAtley)

--

* ## [randombundlegame.com](https://randombundlegame.com/)
    
---

# network

--

* ## organized through links between content

--

* ## tags are _kind of_ related to network content 

--

* ## [Hugo blog post](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-edition-of-my-remixed-data-science-textbook/)

--

* ## [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese)
    
---

# relational

--

* ##similar to hierarchical, but different content types and different relationships are more tightly defined

--

* ## [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080297/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)

---

# implicit vs. explicit aggregation

--

* ## implicit aggregation is built off of _internal_ characteristics of the content

--

    * ### Hugo folders (see `spg_website`)

--

* ## explicit aggregation is defined _externally_ to the content itself

--

    * ### [302 About page](https://super-gumdrop-60116b.netlify.app/about/)


---

# static vs. dynamic aggregation

--

* ## static aggregation is hand-picked ahead of time and is arbitrary

--

    * ### [Project Zion series](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/category/steamers-and-sodas/)


--

* ## dynamic aggregation is automatically-generated "on the fly" and based on criteria


--
    * ### [Ananke theme recommended reads](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-edition-of-my-remixed-data-science-textbook/)


---

# fixed vs. variable aggregation

--

* ### both of these derive from dynamic aggregations

--

* ### a fixed aggregation is the same every time for everyone

--

* ### a variable aggregation changes based on context

--

* ### [YouTube example]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYRp8oP0yiw&list=OLAK5uy_n_KoKi3ioPEsTMStsk_DIjRjvSZwBbIhg))
