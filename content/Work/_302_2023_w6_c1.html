# content aggregation

--

> *An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/aggregation/)

--

can you think of content aggregation examples in the content that you consume?

--

> *The Project Zion Podcast employs a combination of curated series, tags, and an extensive search function to allow listeners to discover the content on their website.*

Caleb Faris

--

* "**organization** or **presentation**"

--

> *This reminds me of how many of our first websites were set up on WordPress and Hugo*

Ethan Johnson

---

# content aggregation matters!

--

> *after a point a user will give up or retry searching for something, so you should make things as streamlined as possible*

Whitman Joyner

--

> *As a user, at times I can feel very overwhelmed when presented with menu bar within a menu bar etc. This leaves me feel like I am hunting for content/information.*

Zach Talley

--

> *However, something that stuck out to me in the interview is the idea that they are making "evergreen content." *

Sophia Medley

--

> *they have so many pieces of content to organize. *

---

# hierarchical

--

* organized like a family tree, with "parent" and "child" content

--

* menus and categories are especially helpful here

--

--

* [randombundlegame.com](https://randombundlegame.com/)
    
---

# network

--

* organized through links between content

--

* tags are _kind of_ related to network content

--

# relational

--

* similar to hierarchical, but different content types and different relationships are more tightly defined

--

* Project Zion Podcast

--

* [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080297/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)

---

# implicit vs. explicit aggregation

--

* implicit aggregation is built off of the attributes _internal_ to the content itself

--

* explicit aggregation is defined _externally_ to the content itself

--

> *[implicit aggregation] requires less work and minimizes the chances of human error in development.*

Chris Frondal

--

> *I still think I prefer [the explicit] method and the control it gives you*

Jacob Hunt

---

# static vs. dynamic aggregation

--

* static aggregation is hand-picked ahead of time and is arbitrary

--

* dynamic aggregation is automatically-generated "on the fly" and based on criteria

--

* [Project Zion series](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/category/steamers-and-sodas/)



---

# fixed vs. variable aggregation

--

* both of these derive from dynamic aggregations

--

* a fixed aggregation is the same every time for everyone

--

* a variable aggregation changes based on context
