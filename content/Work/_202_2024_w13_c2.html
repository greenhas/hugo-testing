# "standard" Windows groups
(Meyers et al., 2023, pp. 510-511)

--

* **Standard Account (Users)**: "cannot edit the Registry or access critical system files"

--

* **Guests**: "enables someone who does not have an account on the system to log on by using a guest account"

# why learn the command-line interface?

---

class: center, middle

# "First, if you know what you're doing, you can do most jobs more quickly by typing a text command than by clicking through a graphical user interface (GUI)."

(Meyers et al., 2023, p. 595)

---

class: center, middle

# "Second, a *command-line interface (CLI)* doesn't take much operating system firepower, so it's the natural choice for jobs where you don't need or don't want a full-blown GUI for an OS."

(Meyers et al., 2023, p. 595)

---

class: center, middle

# "Third, you can combine multiple text commands to automate complex tasks." 

(Meyers et al., 2023, p. 595)

---

class: center, middle

## "Most of the time all you need is to enter one or two commands, but sometimes you will find yourself repeating the same series of commands over and over. When you find yourself in this situation, it might be a good idea to write a *script*—a small program that helps automate a task by collecitng a series of commands and giving them a name."

(Meyers et al., 2023, p. 638)
