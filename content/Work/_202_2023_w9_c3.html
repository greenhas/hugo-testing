# "This year, the French government began requiring tech manufacturers to list an “indice de réparabilité,” a repairability score, on product pages for items like the iPhone and MacBook. If a device can be repaired, then its life can be extended, saving consumers money and the planet the burden of so many trashed gadgets."

# Another example of this in iPhones are with their glass screens. I remember when the glass screens were affordable and easy to change on the iphone. This applied to the iphone 5s and before. Apple saw an opportunity in this and started implementing screens that were much more harder or nearly impossible for private parties to change the screens.
