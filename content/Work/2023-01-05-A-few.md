One thing that startled us about the data is how often students treated other edtech apps and platforms (e.g., Canvas, Kahoot, Zoom) as equivalent to Dojo, when we saw Dojo as a different kind of edtech. I've been meaning to write that up for years, and I'm finally getting off my butt and doing it. I spent today getting the data organized so that we can do some tallies as an empirical basis for the article.
