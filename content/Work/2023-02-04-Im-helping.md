I've been wanting to do something about the online (and, thereby, intentionally international) Toronto Community of Christ congregation, but I've had trouble figuring out what exactly that would be. Today, an idea clicked. I was going through their YouTube and Facebook videos for some early data collection when I realized just how different the two platform experiences are. So, I figure I'll do something on "physical and digital geographies": How broadcasting church allows Beyond the Walls to transcend physical borders but creates new digital ones.
