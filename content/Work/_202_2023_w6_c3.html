# Application Activity

class: center, middle

# "Whatever your main computer is, it has a motherboard and could not function without it."

---

class: center, middle 

# "Now that we've read about all of the fundamental hardware in a computer, you could probably take a look at your computer's motherboard and identify some of the different parts (or at least make educated guesses)."

---

class: center, middle 

# "With most Raspberry Pi models, the motherboard is exposed, so if you have one of those, you can just take a picture of the motherboard and get to work."

---

class: center, middle 

# "Whatever your situation, DuckDuckGo (or Google) will be helpful here, and [the iFixit website's list of parts](https://www.ifixit.com/Parts) might be even more helpful, since they stock motherboards for all kinds of machines."

---

class: center, middle

# "I want you to identify at least four of its components that relate to chapters 3-6 of the book."

---

class: center, middle

# "I don't expect perfect accuracy here."

---

class: center, middle

# "we've all read enough that you ought to be able to make educated guesses, so I do care about the reasoning behind your identification, and I do expect you to do more than make wild guesses"

---

class: center, middle

# "Create four different slides, all of which have the image of your motherboard on them. On each slide, include..."

## "arrows and textboxes to point out one of the parts you're identifying"

## "an explanation of what (you believe) the part is and how you've made that identification"

## "a description of what concept from the book it refers to and the page number where that concept is described"

# "Her Boulangism didn’t go easily. After downloading the new firmware from the darknet, she had to remove the case... and locate a specific component and then short out two of its pins with a pair of tweezers while booting it. This dropped the toaster into a test mode that the developers had deactivated, but not removed."

# "The only reason she’d been able to rent in this building was that the developer had to promise that they’d make some low-income housing available in exchange for permission to build fifty stories instead of the thirty that the other buildings in the neighborhood rose to."

# "The kitchen had 'all major appliances,' just as advertised... They all started working once she’d input her debit-card number, and they presented her with menus of approved consumables: the dishes that would work in the dishwasher, the range of food that would work with the toaster, from bread to ready-meals."

# "Amazon's action flies in the face of what people expect when they purchase a book. Under the 'right of first sale' in the U.S., people can do whatever they like with a book after purchasing it, including giving it to a friend or reselling it. There is no option for a bookseller to take that book back once it's sold."

# "'But it’s not the bread that’s copyrighted, it’s the software in the toaster, all the stuff we change when we jailbreak it... So if it has code in it, and there’s an access control, you’re not allowed to change the code. Even if it belongs to you!'"

# "I believe — really believe — in the stirring words of the Maker Manifesto: if you can't open it, you don't own it. Screws not glue. The original Apple ][+ came with schematics for the circuit boards, and birthed a generation of hardware and software hackers who upended the world for the better."
