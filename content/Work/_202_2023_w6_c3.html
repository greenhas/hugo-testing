# Application Activity

---

class: center, middle

# "Whatever your main computer is, it has a motherboard and could not function without it."

---

class: center, middle 

# "Now that we've read about all of the fundamental hardware in a computer, you could probably take a look at your computer's motherboard and identify some of the different parts (or at least make educated guesses)."

---

class: center, middle 

# "With most Raspberry Pi models, the motherboard is exposed, so if you have one of those, you can just take a picture of the motherboard and get to work."

---

class: center, middle 

# "Whatever your situation, DuckDuckGo (or Google) will be helpful here, and [the iFixit website's list of parts](https://www.ifixit.com/Parts) might be even more helpful, since they stock motherboards for all kinds of machines."

---

class: center, middle

# "I want you to identify at least four of its components that relate to chapters 3-6 of the book."

---

class: center, middle

# "I don't expect perfect accuracy here."

---

class: center, middle

# "we've all read enough that you ought to be able to make educated guesses, so I do care about the reasoning behind your identification, and I do expect you to do more than make wild guesses"

---

class: center, middle

# "Create four different slides, all of which have the image of your motherboard on them. On each slide, include..."

## "arrows and textboxes to point out one of the parts you're identifying"

## "an explanation of what (you believe) the part is and how you've made that identification"

## "a description of what concept from the book it refers to and the page number where that concept is described"

# "This is all bad enough when talking about smart home hubs or smart refrigerators, but it’s quite another thing entirely when it comes to medical implants. IEEE Spectrum has the Cory Doctorow-esque cautionary tale of Second Sight Medical Products whose Argus optical implants were commonly installed in patients in the early aughts to help them see. Accurately heralded as immeasurably innovative at the time, these devices may soon no longer work or be supported because the company that made them is going bankrupt"

# "What surprised me the most is why a toaster would need a toast id."

Trenton Breitenstein

class: center, middle

# "The toaster was also very reminiscent of the Juicero, a smart juicer that could only accept authorized Juicero cartridges."

Henry Bryant

---

class: center, middle

# "Juicero's juicer — also called Juicero — is easy to make fun of. Really, all you have to do is describe it. It's expensive. It has Wi-Fi. It can't juice produce bought from the store. It won't make juice if your internet is down. And it won't make juice if your pack of Juicero-approved produce is just a day past its expiration date (the juicer scans a code on each pack, then looks it up online to verify freshness). It really is a ludicrous product."

---

class: center, middle

# "While Juicero’s product was always going to be unnecessary insofar as it was a ridiculous, Wi-Fi-connected, luxury juicer, the fact that it isn’t even needed to create the juice makes the product truly unnecessary."

# "Her Boulangism didn’t go easily. After downloading the new firmware from the darknet, she had to remove the case... and locate a specific component and then short out two of its pins with a pair of tweezers while booting it. This dropped the toaster into a test mode that the developers had deactivated, but not removed."

# "The only reason she’d been able to rent in this building was that the developer had to promise that they’d make some low-income housing available in exchange for permission to build fifty stories instead of the thirty that the other buildings in the neighborhood rose to."

# "The kitchen had 'all major appliances,' just as advertised... They all started working once she’d input her debit-card number, and they presented her with menus of approved consumables: the dishes that would work in the dishwasher, the range of food that would work with the toaster, from bread to ready-meals."

Samuel Kirkpatrick

# "We had stopped the car for a quick hike down to the beach and when we returned found we could no longer use my phone to start the car. A customer service representative told us by phone the car’s software could not be remotely reset as it was out of cellular service range. It needed to be towed."

# "There’s nothing stopping a driver from changing the oil or rotating the tires on their own car, so why should it be any different with electronic devices?"

# "In 2013, Dana Lewis worked with John Costik to refine the code he'd written to access the data from his son's continuous glucose monitor (CGM); they teamed up with Ben West, who was reverse-engineering insulin pumps, and created a 'closed loop' system that could automate insulin delivery."

class: center, middle

# "These companies had a very weird anti-looping message. They claimed that loopers' exploitation of the defects in their pumps and monitors was, itself, a security risk. Med-tech monopolists like Abbott abused copyright law to force Github to nuke the code that made looping possible:"

class: center, middle

# "Now, it's clear that med-tech companies have a security problem. Medtronic's insulin pumps were insecure enough that security researchers demonstrated a proof-of-concept 'universal remote for killing people' that exploited its defects"

# "Amazon's action flies in the face of what people expect when they purchase a book. Under the 'right of first sale' in the U.S., people can do whatever they like with a book after purchasing it, including giving it to a friend or reselling it. There is no option for a bookseller to take that book back once it's sold."
