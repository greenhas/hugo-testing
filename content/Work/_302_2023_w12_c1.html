# when editorial process goes wrong!

November 17, 2020 *New York Times* [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/world/europe/france-website-obituaries.html) by Aurelien Breeden: 

> *For a brief moment this week, startled readers of a French news site had to grapple with the apparent demise of Queen Elizabeth II of England; Pelé, the Brazilian soccer legend; Clint Eastwood; Brigitte Bardot; and dozens of other celebrities and world leaders.*

> *As it turned out, the website of Radio France Internationale had mistakenly published about 100 prewritten obituaries for prominent figures.*

> *Several hours after the obituaries first ran on Monday, the public radio station, which broadcasts in France and abroad, apologized and started taking the reports offline. It said unedited drafts had been accidentally published as it moved its website to a new content management system. Online platforms like Google and Yahoo News then automatically picked up some of the articles.*

August 8, 2022 *The Onion* [article](https://www.theonion.com/note-do-not-run-until-fucking-queen-is-dead-or-people-1849511595): 

> *LONDON—After 70[?] years as the ruling monarch of the United Kingdom and [CHECK HOW MANY COUNTRIES SHE’S IN CHARGE OF OR ELSE TWITTER PEDANTS WILL GET MAD] Queen Elizabeth died [PEACEFULLY OR PAINFULLY—COPY WHATEVER BBC OBIT SAYS] in [TK LOCATION] at the age of 89.

February 28, 2022 *The Scotsman* [story](https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/russian-news-agency-appears-to-accidentally-publish-article-claiming-victory-3590253): 

> *It is the blunder feared by every news outlet that has pre-prepared articles written in the event of a sudden breaking story.*

> *For Russian state-run news agency RIA-Novosti, the error was arguably worse than many similar bloopers, when it published a comment piece [two days after the invasion] proclaiming Russian victory in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.*

July 6, 2023 *The Verge* [story](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23785645/go-media-ai-generated-articles-gizmodo-av-club-artificial-intelligence-bots):

> *G/O’s early experiments with AI tools began on Wednesday through a couple of articles appearing on Gizmodo and The AV Club credited to the publications’ respective bots. And almost immediately, there were embarrassing mistakes.*

> *The Gizmodo bot’s first story, “A Chronological List of Star Wars Movies & TV Shows,” contained factual errors about the in-universe chronology of the franchise, something fans were quick to point out.*

> *James Whitbrook, a deputy editor of *io9*, where the story appeared, tweeted that he was unaware the article would be published until shortly before. Whitbrook also said that “no one at *io9* played a part in its editing or publication.”*

# workflow

> *An framework to move content through a defined set or map of specific steps, activities, or tasks.*

--

> *The content can only be “in” one such state for a particular workflow at a time. When that state resolves, content will “move” to another state, and continue until the workflow ends.*

# extension

---

# extensibility model
