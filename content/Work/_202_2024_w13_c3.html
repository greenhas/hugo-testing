If you aren't paying very close attention to **what you're supposed to type** and **what you've actually typed in the Terminal**, you're going to run into instances where your commands plain don't work.

## "PHIA: Blumberg felt about it the way I did. Phishing is for dummies. But then a month later, news came out that the President of France, his campaign got phished, like some of his staffers ended up handing over their personal passwords. And actually, I started to notice that a lot of the hacks that I’m reading about recently, they start with phishing—John Podesta, that was phishing, the Sony hack by North Korea—that was phishing."
