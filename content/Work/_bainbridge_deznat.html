* ### traditional authority

    * "an everyday belief in sanctity of long-established traditions and the legitimacy of those whose authority derives from those traditions" (Weber, 1921/2019, p. 342)

# "Exactly how does one make sure a hashtag is regulated?"

document 312 [modified]

???

... even DezNat recognizes the absurdity of claiming that anyone who uses a Twitter hashtag is part of a cohesive, unified movement. This quote from our data is a response to a DezNat critic who argued that people were getting out of control and that the movement needed to do better about policing itself. However, the DezNat partisan's response is essentially "you can't control a hashtag." While that's true, it raises questions about DezNat's true unity, and disunity's implications for their claims to authority.

# how is religious authority defined in Latter-day Saint circles?

???

The other big question that we're coming away with is the question of how religious authority is actually defined in Latter-day Saint circles. 

DezNat participants are full-throated supporters of the Church and eager to prop up this authority, but our data suggest that they aren't entirely sure what the mechanics or the limits of that authority are.
