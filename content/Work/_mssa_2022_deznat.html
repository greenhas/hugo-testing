Hi everyone, my name is Spencer Greenhalgh, and I'm with the School of Information Science at the University of Kentucky. Today, I'm presenting with Amy Chapman from Teachers College at Columbia University on some work we've done together investigating reactionary Mormons on Twitter and their trying to work out how religious authority works online. We've titled this presentation "canceling taco Tuesday," which is a reference that will make a lot more sense in a few minutes.

To start with some background...

# #DezNat

???

The reactionary Mormons that we're studying are participants in the #DezNat hashtag on Twitter, which is purportedly a hashtag for Latter-day Saints...

# "#DezNat means standing up and speaking up for Christ here on twitter."

???

... we've argued at length that this is a disingenous self-image, given the clear influence of far-right and anti-feminist thinking on activity in the hashtag.

<img src="https://spencergreenhalgh.com/brigham_groyper.png" width = "600">

???

For example, on the surface, this meme from our data is a very online depiction of the 1844 Mormon succession crisis, but the depiction of Brigham Young as a white nationalist frog meme, and the description of Joseph Smith III as a "momma's boy" demonstrate some clear preferences in terms of politics and gender performance.

This is the sort of observation that popular and media coverage of DezNat has focused on, but while working with this data, we found that the DezNat movement also had things to say in response to two questions that scholar Heidi Campbell has posed about religious authority in the online sphere:

---

<h1>"What does religious authority look like in an age of digital media<span style="color:white">, and, is it still held and defined by recognized religious leaders and the structures they work within?"</span></h1>

... these questions are particularly salient in the context of Mormonism.

# "present Mormon identities and approach Mormon practice in ways other than those that are typically seen (or approved of)"

Greenhalgh, S. P., Staudt Willet, B. K., & Koehler, M. J. (2019). Approaches to Mormon identity and practice in the #ldsconf Twitter hashtag. *Journal of Media and Religion*, *18*(4), 122-133. https://doi.org/10.1080/15348423.2019.1696121

I've written previously on how Mormon Twitter allows participants to act and identify in ways that aren't encouraged or even allowed in formal Latter-day Saint spaces, and...

McDannell, C. (2019). *Sister saints: Mormon women since the end of polygamy*. Oxford University Press.

???

... historian Colleen McDannell has noted that those voices that the institutional church intentionally shut out in previous decades can now easily speak to other Mormons through social media. In doing so, they implicitly assume a certain amount of religious authority, and we suggest that the DezNat movement is a reaction to the fact that more liberal voices hold sway on Mormon Twitter in ways that they do not appreciate.

... the weekend that the April 2019 General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints took place. In short, lots of official Latter-day Saint sermons and business happening, and lots of Mormon activity on Twitter.

# findings and discussion

???

Today, we'd like to go over what our analysis has told us so far, and we'll divide our findings into three parts.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3 style="color:white">DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1 style="color:white">Threats to Authority (and Tacos)</h1>

???

First, we'll talk about how DezNat sees their co-religionists as chipping away at Latter-day Saint authority structures.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3>DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1 style="color:white">Threats to Authority (and Tacos?)</h1>

???

Second, we'll discuss how DezNat itself claims religious authority in responding to these perceived threats.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3>DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1>Threats to Authority (and Tacos)</h1>

???

Finally, though, we'll discuss the threats that DezNat participants themselves pose to their own understanding of religious authority, including those related to tacos; we've made this section title a bit bigger because this we're planning to zoom through the first two and spend some extra time on this last point. 

---

class: center, middle

background-color: #272822

<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center">The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat</h2>

???

Again, we're going to start by discussing how DezNat sees their co-religionists as threats to religious authority and how they see themselves as responding to those threats.

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## how DezNat sees itself

???

Helpful here is one of the many tweets in our data where a DezNat partisan is trying to describe the movement. DezNat had existed for nearly a year at this point and had already attracted attention and controversy, so many of the accounts that we studied were eager to set the record straight. So, in one tweet, a DezNat participant described the movement as

---

class: center, middle 

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet<span style=color:white>, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification, which is intended to lead away other members</span></h1>

document 1082

???

"a group of folks interested in following the prophet"—that is, they're interested in shoring up Latter-day Saint authority structures

---

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification<span style=color:white>, which is intended to lead away other members</span></h1>

???

they see themselves as a response to other Latter-day Saints "tweeting apostasy," or chipping away at authority

---

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification, which is intended to lead away other members"</h1>

document 1082

???

and they see those other Latter-day Saints as "leading away" other people on Twitter—posing further threats to religious authority unless they are stopped

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## how DezNat relates to others

???

Naturally, given that perception, DezNat participants are often belligerent toward other groups of people on Mormon Twitter

---

class: center, middle

<h1> "The homosexually [sic] community seems to cause so many problems everywhere they go. ... <span style=color:white>Look how they view conference and the gospel, it ALWAYS has to be about their issues"</span>

document 1345

???

... a DezNat partisan complained about the "homosexually community," describing them as trying to take over

---

<h1> "The homosexually [sic] community seems to cause so many problems everywhere they go. ... Look how they view conference and the gospel, it ALWAYS has to be about their issues"

events like the General Conference with their concerns. DezNat perceives queer Mormons as a threat and speaks out against them.

# "this is what apostasy looks like"

document 495

???

Unsurprisingly, feminists are also seen as a threat, so in response to a post by the Mormon feminist blog *The Exponent*, one DezNat participant described the post as apostasy, encouraging faithful Latter-day Saints to steer clear of dangerous feminists. 

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## DezNat's self-assigned responsibilities

???

This belligerence corresponds with responsibilities that DezNat has assigned itself to bring back order to Mormon Twitter

---

class: center, middle

# "splintering" vs. "sifting"

document 1379

???

So, when a writer on a progressive Mormon blog expressed concern about online Mormonism splintering into different echo chambers, one prominent DezNat account argued that what was actually happening was "sifting"—the wicked were being separated from the righteous, and DezNat was helping bring that about through their activity.

---

class: center, middle

# "This is where the Church is going. Either you course correct or you don't."

document 1080 [modified]

???

We often saw a kind of "in or out" attitude among DezNat accounts, such as this one, which warned other people on Mormon Twitter that they either needed to change to conform to Church teachings or they were going to be left behind—there is no middle ground for DezNat

---

class: center, middle

background-color: #272822

<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center">DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h2>

???

None of this content is surprising coming from a conservative religious group on Twitter, but what's more interesting is the implicit and even explicit ways that DezNat claims religious authority to do so.

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## the Church needs DezNat

???

For example, DezNat often argued that the Church needed DezNat to do what it was doing. This was most visible in conversations surrounding a "social media fast" that were happening this weekend. In April 2019, Russell Nelson had been president of the church for just over a year, and during his tenure, he had twice issued challenges for church members to abstain from social media for ten days. One challenge had been to the youth of the church, and the other one had been directed specifically at adult women, so there was a lot of curiosity going into this General Conference about whether a similar invitation would be issued to adult men. However, some male DezNat participants were confident that there wouldn't be such an invitation, because, they argued:

---

class: center, middle

# "The brethren know, the world needs #DezNat now, more than ever."

document 773

???

Church leaders knew that their work was needed. There are some interesting gender dynamics here, in that church leaders are almost exclusively men and DezNat participants are assumed to be men, but here, what we're focusing on is this idea that the Latter-day Saint leadership knows about DezNat and wants them to keep doing what they're doing. We also see this expressed in a meme using similar language:

---

class: center, middle

<img src="https://spencergreenhalgh.com/DezNat_needed.png" width = "600">

document 749

???

And then once it became clear that Nelson would not be asking men to try out a social media fast, this kind of reasoning came out again, with arguments like: 

---

class: center, middle

# "#DezNat is needed to cry repentance to twitter dot com"

document 1073

---

class: center, middle

# "the brethren need #DezNat to continue supporting the gospel of Jesus Christ with exactness"

document 1291

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## the Church *is* DezNat

???

Perhaps even more interesting, though, is the argument that the Church *is* DezNat—that is, not just that leaders approve of the DezNat movement but that Church leadership are somehow ex officio members of DezNat. They might not use the hashtag, but they're on the same wavelength. This is perhaps most evident in a Twitter thread that happened right after the General Conference had concluded. In a kind of evaluative summary, one prominent account suggested that...

---

class: center, middle

# "the Brethren are well versed in #DezNat"

document 1278

???

"the Brethren are well versed in #DezNat." in a reply, another participant took things a step further, arguing that  

---

class: center, middle

# "the Brethern [sic] and Sisters are #DezNat 😎"

document 1278

???

The Church leadership were, for all intents and purposes, part of the #DezNat movement. The first account seems to have taken a liking to this argument, because about an hour later, he came across a tweet from a more progressive Mormon, who raised concerns that some of the sermons during the General Conference would encourage DezNat in its belligerent actions. His response to this tweet was to say "sure, you might think they're encouraging #DezNat, but..."

---

class: center, middle

# "That's because they are #DezNat 😉"

document 1292

???

"That's because they are #DezNat." That is, in practical terms, there is no distinction between Latter-day Saint leadership and the #DezNat hashtag on Twitter. This is a **remarkable** claim. 

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## authority and unity

???

However, it's not that hard to reconstruct how DezNat comes to this conclusion, and while time constraints are going to keep us focused on DezNat thinking in our data, those familiar with Mormonism will note the ways that this thinking builds on official church teachings. In short, DezNat sees religious authority as being transferred through unity.

---

class: center, middle

# "the brethren are united when it comes to truth and doctrine"

document 561 [modified]

???

In short, DezNat argues that the 15 men at the top of the church hierarchy are united in their commitment to eternal truth. DezNat actually responds negatively to suggestions to the contrary; for example, they correct anyone

who suggests that particular apostles have particular conservative agendas, and if some progressive Mormons might suggest that one apostle is pushing back against another apostle's sermon, that makes them

---

class: center, middle

# "These people are evil."

document 663 [modified]

???

Well, evil. For what it's worth, it's it very clear that apostles have aggressively disagreed with each other throughout Latter-day Saint history, so DezNat's view of this is wildly oversimplified. However, this is a necessary truth to set up the next part of the argument, which goes like this:

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"The Brethren are united and make every decision unanimously with the confirmation of the Spirit.</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">#DezNat sustains the Brethren completely and is united behind them.</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">So who is dividing?</h1>

document 1359

???

Church leaders are united with each other, which gives them access to divine revelation.

<h1>"The Brethren are united and make every decision unanimously with the confirmation of the Spirit.</h1>

<h1>"#DezNat sustains the Brethren completely and is united behind them.</h1>

DezNat, in turn, is united with Church leaders, and therefore...

<h1>"The Brethren are united and make every decision unanimously with the confirmation of the Spirit.</h1>

<h1>"#DezNat sustains the Brethren completely and is united behind them.</h1>

it's inappropriate to describe DezNat as divisive—they are acting with ecclesiastical and even divine authority
