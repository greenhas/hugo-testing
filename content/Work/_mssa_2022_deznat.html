Hi everyone, my name is Spencer Greenhalgh, and I'm with the School of Information Science at the University of Kentucky. Today, I'm presenting with Amy Chapman from Teachers College at Columbia University on some work we've done together investigating reactionary Mormons on Twitter and their trying to work out how religious authority works online. We've titled this presentation "canceling taco Tuesday," which is a reference that will make a lot more sense in a few minutes.

To start with some background...

# #DezNat

The reactionary Mormons that we're studying are participants in the #DezNat hashtag on Twitter, which is purportedly a hashtag for Latter-day Saints...

# "it is disingenuous to describe the movement as merely about Latter-day Saint orthodoxy"

Greenhalgh, S. P., & Chapman, A. L. (in press). "Come for the memes, stay for defending the faith": Far-right and anti-feminist red pill influences in the #DezNat Twitter hashtag. *Journal of the Mormon Social Science Association*.

???

... we've argued at length that this is a disingenous self-image, given the clear influence of far-right and anti-feminist thinking on activity in the hashtag.

???

For example, on the surface, this meme from our data is a very online depiction of the 1844 Mormon succession crisis, but the depiction of Brigham Young as a white nationalist frog meme, and the description of Joseph Smith III as a "momma's boy" demonstrate some clear preferences in terms of politics and gender performance.

This is the sort of observation that popular and media coverage of DezNat has focused on, but while working with this data, we found that the DezNat movement also had things to say in response to two questions that scholar Heidi Campbell has posed about religious authority in the online sphere:

---

Campbell, H. (2021). *Digital creatives and the rethinking of religious authority*. Routledge

???

... these questions are particularly salient in the context of Mormonism.

# "present Mormon identities and approach Mormon practice in ways other than those that are typically seen (or approved of)"

Greenhalgh, S. P., Staudt Willet, B. K., & Koehler, M. J. (2019). Approaches to Mormon identity and practice in the #ldsconf Twitter hashtag. *Journal of Media and Religion*, *18*(4), 122-133. https://doi.org/10.1080/15348423.2019.1696121

I've written previously on how Mormon Twitter allows participants to act and identify in ways that aren't encouraged or even allowed in formal Latter-day Saint spaces, and...

# "Church members marginalized in the eighties and nineties—intellectuals, feminists, gays—gravitated to social media as a safe place to expres their ideas"

McDannell, C. (2019). *Sister saints: Mormon women since the end of polygamy*. Oxford University Press.

???

... historian Colleen McDannell has noted that those voices that the institutional church intentionally shut out in previous decades can now easily speak to other Mormons through social media. In doing so, they implicitly assume a certain amount of religious authority, and we suggest that the DezNat movement is a reaction to the fact that more liberal voices hold sway on Mormon Twitter in ways that they do not appreciate.

# 1,379 screenshots 

# tweets and context

# April 3rd through 9th, 2019

???

... the weekend that the April 2019 General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints took place. In short, lots of official Latter-day Saint sermons and business happening, and lots of Mormon activity on Twitter.

We were also very attentive to the unique ethical considerations that arise in internet research and would be happy to elaborate on those later.

# findings and discussion

???

Today, we'd like to go over what our analysis has told us so far, and we'll divide our findings into three parts.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3 style="color:white">DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1 style="color:white">Threats to Authority (and Tacos)</h1>

???

First, we'll talk about how DezNat sees their co-religionists as chipping away at Latter-day Saint authority structures.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3>DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1 style="color:white">Threats to Authority (and Tacos?)</h1>

???

Second, we'll discuss how DezNat itself claims religious authority in responding to these perceived threats.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3>DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1>Threats to Authority (and Tacos)</h1>

???

Finally, though, we'll discuss the threats that DezNat participants themselves pose to their own understanding of religious authority, including those related to tacos; we've made this section title a bit bigger because this we're planning to zoom through the first two and spend some extra time on this last point. 

---

class: center, middle

<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center">The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat</h2>

???

Again, we're going to start by discussing how DezNat sees their co-religionists as threats to religious authority and how they see themselves as responding to those threats.

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## how DezNat sees itself

???

Helpful here is one of the many tweets in our data where a DezNat partisan is trying to describe the movement. DezNat had existed for nearly a year at this point and had already attracted attention and controversy, so many of the accounts that we studied were eager to set the record straight. So, in one tweet, a DezNat participant described the movement as

---

class: center, middle 

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet<span style=color:white>, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification, which is intended to lead away other members</span></h1>

document 1082

???

"a group of folks interested in following the prophet"—that is, they're interested in shoring up Latter-day Saint authority structures

---

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification<span style=color:white>, which is intended to lead away other members</span></h1>

???

they see themselves as a response to other Latter-day Saints "tweeting apostasy," or chipping away at authority

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification, which is intended to lead away other members"</h1>

???

and they see those other Latter-day Saints as "leading away" other people on Twitter—posing further threats to religious authority unless they are stopped

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## how DezNat relates to others

???

Naturally, given that perception, DezNat participants are often belligerent toward other groups of people on Mormon Twitter

---

<h1> "The homosexually [sic] community seems to cause so many problems everywhere they go. ... <span style=color:white>Look how they view conference and the gospel, it ALWAYS has to be about their issues"</span>

... a DezNat partisan complained about the "homosexually community," describing them as trying to take over

events like the General Conference with their concerns. DezNat perceives queer Mormons as a threat and speaks out against them.

# "this is what apostasy looks like"

document 495

???

Unsurprisingly, feminists are also seen as a threat, so in response to a post by the Mormon feminist blog *The Exponent*, one DezNat participant described the post as apostasy, encouraging faithful Latter-day Saints to steer clear of dangerous feminists. 

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## DezNat's self-assigned responsibilities

???

This belligerence corresponds with responsibilities that DezNat has assigned itself to bring back order to Mormon Twitter

---

class: center, middle

# "splintering" vs. "sifting"

document 1379

???

So, when a writer on a progressive Mormon blog expressed concern about online Mormonism splintering into different echo chambers, one prominent DezNat account argued that what was actually happening was "sifting"—the wicked were being separated from the righteous, and DezNat was helping bring that about through their activity.

---

class: center, middle

# "This is where the Church is going. Either you course correct or you don't."

document 1080 [modified]

???

We often saw a kind of "in or out" attitude among DezNat accounts, such as this one, which warned other people on Mormon Twitter that they either needed to change to conform to Church teachings or they were going to be left behind—there is no middle ground for DezNat
