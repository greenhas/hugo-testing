Hi everyone, my name is Spencer Greenhalgh, and I'm with the School of Information Science at the University of Kentucky. Today, I'm presenting with Amy Chapman from Teachers College at Columbia University on some work we've done together investigating reactionary Mormons on Twitter and their trying to figure out how religious authority works online. We've titled this presentation "canceling taco Tuesday," which is a reference that will make a lot more sense in a few minutes.

To start with some background...

# #DezNat

???

The reactionary Mormons that we're studying are participants in the #DezNat hashtag on Twitter, which is purportedly a hashtag for Latter-day Saints...

???

... we've argued at length that this is a disingenous self-image, given the clear influence of far-right and anti-feminist thinking on activity in the hashtag.

class: center, middle

<img src="https://spencergreenhalgh.com/brigham_groyper.png" width = "600">

???

For example, on the surface, this meme from our data is a very online depiction of the 1844 Mormon succession crisis, but the depiction of Brigham Young as a white nationalist frog meme, and the description of Joseph Smith III as a "momma's boy" demonstrate some clear preferences in terms of politics and gender performance.

This is the sort of observation that popular and media coverage of DezNat has focused on, but while working with this data, we found that the DezNat movement also had things to say in response to two questions that scholar Heidi Campbell has posed about religious authority in the online sphere:

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"What does religious authority look like in an age of digital media<span style="color:white">, and, is it still held and defined by recognized religious leaders and the structures they work within?"</span></h1>

<h1>"What does religious authority look like in an age of digital media, and, is it still held and defined by recognized religious leaders and the structures they work within?"</h1>

Campbell, H. (2021). *Digital creatives and the rethinking of religious authority*. Routledge

???

... these questions are particularly salient in the context of Mormonism. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a very hierarchical, top-down conception of religious authority, but phenomena like Mormon Twitter

???

... historian Colleen McDannell has noted that those voices that the institutional church intentionally shut out in previous decades can now easily speak to other Mormons through social media. In doing so, they implicitly assume a certain amount of religious authority, and we suggest that the DezNat movement is a reaction to the fact that more liberal voices hold sway on Mormon Twitter in ways that they do not appreciate.

So, as we'll see throughout this presentation, DezNat pushes back against the more free-for-all approach to religious authority that exists online and offers a sort of grassroots, emic theory of how religious authority works on the internet.

... the weekend that the April 2019 General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints took place. In short, lots of official Latter-day Saint sermons and business happening, and lots of Mormon activity on Twitter.

# findings and discussion

???

Today, we'd like to go over what our analysis has told us so far, and we'll divide our findings into three parts.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3 style="color:white">DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1 style="color:white">Threats to Authority (and Tacos)</h1>

???

First, we'll talk about how DezNat sees their co-religionists as chipping away at Latter-day Saint authority structures.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3>DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1 style="color:white">Threats to Authority (and Tacos?)</h1>

???

Second, we'll discuss how DezNat itself claims religious authority in responding to these perceived threats.

---

class: center, middle

<h3> The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat </h3>

<h3>DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h3>

<h1>Threats to Authority (and Tacos)</h1>

???

Finally, though, we'll discuss the threats that DezNat participants themselves pose to their own understanding of religious authority, including those related to tacos; we've made this section title a bit bigger because this we're planning to zoom through the first two and spend some extra time on this last point. 

---

class: center, middle

background-color: #272822

<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center">The World (Wide Web) According to DezNat</h2>

???

Again, we're going to start by discussing how DezNat sees their co-religionists as threats to religious authority and how they see themselves as responding to those threats.

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## how DezNat sees itself

???

Helpful here is one of the many tweets in our data where a DezNat partisan is trying to describe the movement. DezNat had existed for nearly a year at this point and had already attracted attention and controversy, so many of the accounts that we studied were eager to set the record straight. So, in one tweet, a DezNat participant described the movement as

---

class: center, middle 

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet<span style=color:white>, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification, which is intended to lead away other members</span></h1>

???

"a group of folks interested in following the prophet"—that is, they're interested in shoring up Latter-day Saint authority structures

---

???

they see themselves as a response to other Latter-day Saints "tweeting apostasy," or chipping away at authority

---

<h1>"a group of folks interested in following the prophet, and tired of seeing tweeted apostasy from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints without any clarification, which is intended to lead away other members"</h1>

???

and they see those other Latter-day Saints as "leading away" other people on Twitter—posing further threats to religious authority unless they are stopped

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## how DezNat relates to others

???

Naturally, given that perception, DezNat participants are often belligerent toward other groups of people on Mormon Twitter

---

class: center, middle

<h1> "The homosexually [sic] community seems to cause so many problems everywhere they go. ... <span style=color:white>Look how they view conference and the gospel, it ALWAYS has to be about their issues"</span>

events like the General Conference with their concerns. DezNat perceives queer Mormons as a threat and speaks out against them.

# "this is what apostasy looks like"

document 495

???

Unsurprisingly, feminists are also seen as a threat, so in response to a post by the Mormon feminist blog *The Exponent*, one DezNat participant described the post as apostasy, encouraging faithful Latter-day Saints to steer clear of dangerous feminists. 

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## DezNat's self-assigned responsibilities

???

This belligerence corresponds with responsibilities that DezNat has assigned itself to bring back order to Mormon Twitter

---

class: center, middle

# "splintering" vs. "sifting"

document 1379

???

So, when a writer on a progressive Mormon blog expressed concern about online Mormonism splintering into different echo chambers, one prominent DezNat account argued that what was actually happening was "sifting"—the wicked were being separated from the righteous, and DezNat was helping bring that about through their activity.

---

class: center, middle

# "This is where the Church is going. Either you course correct or you don't."

document 1080 [modified]

???

We often saw a kind of "in or out" attitude among DezNat accounts, such as this one, which warned other people on Mormon Twitter that they either needed to change to conform to Church teachings or they were going to be left behind—there is no middle ground for DezNat

---

class: center, middle

background-color: #272822

<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center">DezNat's Claim to Religious Authority</h2>

???

None of this content is surprising coming from a conservative religious group on Twitter, but what's more interesting is the implicit and even explicit ways that DezNat claims religious authority to do so.

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## the Church needs DezNat

???

For example, DezNat often argued that the Church needed DezNat to do what it was doing. This was most visible in conversations surrounding a "social media fast" that were happening this weekend. In April 2019, Russell Nelson had been president of the church for just over a year, and during his tenure, he had twice issued challenges for church members to abstain from social media for ten days. One challenge had been to the youth of the church, and the other one had been directed specifically at adult women, so there was a lot of curiosity going into this General Conference about whether a similar invitation would be issued to adult men. However, some male DezNat participants were confident that there wouldn't be such an invitation, because, they argued:

---

class: center, middle

# "The brethren know, the world needs #DezNat now, more than ever."

document 773

???

Church leaders knew that their work was needed. There are some interesting gender dynamics here, in that church leaders are almost exclusively men and DezNat participants are assumed to be men, but here, what we're focusing on is this idea that the Latter-day Saint leadership knows about DezNat and wants them to keep doing what they're doing. We also see this expressed in a meme using similar language:

---

class: center, middle

<img src="https://spencergreenhalgh.com/DezNat_needed.png" width = "600">

document 749

???

And then once it became clear that Nelson would not be asking men to try out a social media fast, this kind of reasoning came out again, with arguments like: 

---

class: center, middle

# "#DezNat is needed to cry repentance to twitter dot com"

document 1073

---

class: center, middle

# "the brethren need #DezNat to continue supporting the gospel of Jesus Christ with exactness"

document 1291

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## the Church *is* DezNat

???

Perhaps even more interesting, though, is the argument that the Church *is* DezNat—that is, not just that leaders approve of the DezNat movement but that Church leadership are somehow ex officio members of DezNat. They might not use the hashtag, but they're on the same wavelength. This is perhaps most evident in a Twitter thread that happened right after the General Conference had concluded. In a kind of evaluative summary, one prominent account suggested that...

---

class: center, middle

# "the Brethren are well versed in #DezNat"

document 1278

???

"the Brethren are well versed in #DezNat." in a reply, another participant took things a step further, arguing that  

---

class: center, middle

# "the Brethern [sic] and Sisters are #DezNat 😎"

document 1278

???

The Church leadership were, for all intents and purposes, part of the #DezNat movement. The first account seems to have taken a liking to this argument, because about an hour later, he came across a tweet from a more progressive Mormon, who raised concerns that some of the sermons during the General Conference would encourage DezNat in its belligerent actions. His response to this tweet was to say "sure, you might think they're encouraging #DezNat, but..."

---

class: center, middle

# "That's because they are #DezNat 😉"

document 1292

???

"That's because they are #DezNat." That is, in practical terms, there is no distinction between Latter-day Saint leadership and the #DezNat hashtag on Twitter. This is a **remarkable** claim. 

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## authority and unity

???

However, it's not that hard to reconstruct how DezNat comes to this conclusion, and while time constraints are going to keep us focused on DezNat thinking in our data, those familiar with Mormonism will note the ways that this thinking builds on official church teachings. In short, DezNat sees religious authority as being transferred through unity.

---

class: center, middle

# "I literally sat yards away from the Lord's chosen mouthpieces as they spoke the Lord's words"

document 765

???

This begins with the 15 men at the top of the church hierarchy, who are assumed to united with God to the extent that they are extensions of the divine body: To hear Latter-day Saint presidents or apostles speak is to hear God speak—a pretty clear argument for their authority.

---

class: center, middle

# "the brethren are united when it comes to truth and doctrine"

document 561 [modified]

???

This authority is further emphasized by the unity that exists between these men, and it's kind of surprising how insistent DezNat is on this point. 

For example, one Mormon's suggestion that conservative church teachings are driven by specific apostles...

---

class: center, middle

# "It's not just Oaks and Andersen. They all support the Family Proclamation."

document 663 [modified]

???

... was met by a DezNat argument that  Latter-day Saints ought to understand those teachings as coming from the whole body.

Likewise, when some progressive Mormons suggested that one apostle perceived as more liberal was gently pushing back against the sermon of a different apostle perceived as more conservative, a DezNat participant described their co-religionists as...

---

class: center, middle

# "These people are evil."

document 663 [modified]

???

... evil for daring to think that way.

For what it's worth, it's it very clear that apostles have aggressively disagreed with each other throughout Latter-day Saint history, so DezNat's view of this is wildly oversimplified. However, drawing a clear line between unity and authority is important for setting up the next part of the argument, which goes like this:

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"The Brethren are united and make every decision unanimously with the confirmation of the Spirit.</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">#DezNat sustains the Brethren completely and is united behind them.</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">So who is dividing?</h1>

document 1359

???

Church leaders are united with each other and with God.

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"The Brethren are united and make every decision unanimously with the confirmation of the Spirit.</h1>

<h1>"#DezNat sustains the Brethren completely and is united behind them.</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">So who is dividing?</h1>

document 1359

???

DezNat, in turn, is united with Church leaders, and therefore...

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"The Brethren are united and make every decision unanimously with the confirmation of the Spirit.</h1>

<h1>"#DezNat sustains the Brethren completely and is united behind them.</h1>

<h1>"So who is dividing?"</h1>

document 1359

???

it's inappropriate to describe DezNat as divisive—they are acting with ecclesiastical and even divine authority, transferred through unity.


---

class: center, middle

background-color: #272822

<h2 style="color:white; text-align:center">Threats to Authority (and Tacos)</h2>

???

And now, it's finally time to talk about tacos! DezNat rallies around the authority of Latter-day Saint leaders and the way that this authority extends to their movement as they defend Latter-day Saint leaders, so it's interesting to see how DezNat participants themselves took steps to call into question their own theory of authority and unity. 

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## hypothetical limits of prophetic authority

???

Let's start with the ways that DezNat participants were forced to wrestle with whether prophetic authority has limits. In April of 2019, Church leaders took the somewhat surprising step of rolling back a policy restricting the baptism of children of parents in same-sex relationships. To be clear, this wasn't a giant leap forward into becoming a more affirming church—rather, it was the rolling back of a decision made less than four years earlier in response to the Supreme Court case that made marriage equality the law of the land in the United States. That original decision was immediately unpopular, but it was also defended as revelation and the will of God, so to see the Church do an about-face so relatively quickly was somewhat surprising, and this presented a couple of challenges for DezNat. 

First, as one DezNat critic in our data argued...

---

class: center, middle

# "if it was walked back in 2019, it wasn't divine revelation in 2015"

document 118 [modified]

???

... was this really revelation if the policy didn't even last four years? Is it possible for church leaders to make mistakes, and what does that say about their unity with God? 

More interesting for our purposes, though, was a response to this tweet by another DezNat critic, who asked in mock concern:

---

class: center, middle

# "#DezNat must be in rough shape right now, is anyone checking on them?"

document 118 [modified]

???

"Is anyone checking on DezNat? Are they okay?" As I mentioned earlier, DezNat had been around for nearly a year at this point, and it had developed a deserved reputation for homophobia and harassment. When news of the policy change came out, many people on Mormon Twitter assumed that DezNat would be upset by the news and see it as a betrayal. This was seen as a test case for #DezNat—would they defer to ecclesiastical authority if it issued a decision that the movement didn't agree with? Or was their emphasis on religious authority only a convenient justification for their harassment of other Mormons? 

In response, DezNat went on the defensive.

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"If you worry that #DezNat folks are concerned or upset... today, you truly don't get it."</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">"If you sustain the prophet, you sustain him, period."</h1>

document 155
???

For example, this DezNat partisan argued that critics of the movement had it wrong. 

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"If you worry that #DezNat folks are concerned or upset... today, you truly don't get it."</h1>

<h1>"If you sustain the prophet, you sustain him, period."</h1>

document 155

???

#DezNat **was** committed to sustaining the prophet no matter what. It wasn't about the content of the teaching or the nature of the decision, it was about accepting religious authority no matter what. 

In fact, this user continued...

---

class: center, middle

# "If this weekend it is announced that tacos are against the [Word of Wisdom], for example, some of us would be sad, yea even sad unto tears, but those who sustain the prophet as the mouthpiece of the Lord would simply give up tacos."

document 155

???

If church leaders announced that Latter-day Saints were no longer allowed to eat tacos, we might be "sad, yea even sad unto tears," but we'd do it. That's what #DezNat is about. 

While this seems to show some remarkable consistency and commitment, let's contrast it with another tweet from this same DezNat account about two hours earlier in the day: 

---

class: center, middle

<h1> "Proposing hypotheticals that are ridiculous to consider... is creating cracks that don't exist."</h1>

document 142

<h1 style = "text-align:white">


???

"Proposing hypotheticals that are ridiculous to consider... is creating cracks that don't exist." Let's take a step back and add some context. As described earlier, DezNat had a deserved reputation for homophobia, so there was some question as to whether DezNat would respect religious authority in this case. 

When DezNat partisans argued that they were, in fact, committed to respecting religious authority no matter what, some critics of the movement started pushing them on how far "no matter what" actually went. For example, if the announcement had been made that Latter-day Saint temples would solemnize same-sex marriages, would DezNat be on board with that? 

That's the exact question that was posed in this thread, and our DezNat friend, who two hours later is ready to propose the hypothetical situation of giving up tacos out of deference to religious authority, is now arguing that someone else's hypothetical situation is inappropriate.

In short, this DezNat partisan believes that religious authority safely extends to forbidding Mexican food, but seems less confident on whether it would extend to affirming same-sex relationships.

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"if a change that fundamental happened, my testimony would be destroyed"</h1>

<h1>"I know the Church will never change its stance on marriage"</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">"How is that inconsistent?"</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">you aren't "consistently with the prophets"</h1>

document 150 [modified]

???

Another DezNat account participating in this conversation responded more straightforwardly. If church leaders allowed for same-sex marriages, their belief would be destroyed. Why? Because they know that there are limits to prophetic authority (including heteronormativity), and those limits suggest the possibility that Latter-day Saint leaders could, in fact, not be united with God and thereby make a mistake.

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"if a change that fundamental happened, my testimony would be destroyed"</h1>

<h1>"I know the Church will never change its stance on marriage"</h1>

<h1>"How is that inconsistent?"</h1>

<h1 style="color:white">you aren't "consistently with the prophets"</h1>

document 150 [modified]

???

This account took issue with the idea that their stance wasn't consistent, and the critic who brought up the hypothetical situation in the first place explained that if they wouldn't support religious authority in that situation...

---

class: center, middle

<h1>"I know the Church will never change its stance on marriage"</h1>

<h1>"How is that inconsistent?"</h1>

document 150 [modified]

???

their loyalty wasn't simply to prophetic authority, because it's hypothetically possible for Latter-day Saint leaders to make wrong decisions, which, of course, stands in contrast with the theory of authority and unity that DezNat argues in our data. To a certain extent, this argument gives DezNat authority to review and approve the teachings of church authorities, which upends the argument that they had been making.

---

class: center, middle
background-color: #33ccff

## internal disagreements on authority

???

Another interesting site of tension around DezNat and authority also happend in the leadup to the April 2019 General Conference. In the days before the conference began, an internal disagreement arose between members of the movement that were equally committed to respecting religious authority but disagreed on what that meant.

Most of this happened before the timeframe that we're studying, so we don't have access to all the details, but one DezNat participant had recently gotten engaged, this had somehow led to a conversation about the appropriate level of intimacy between an engaged-but-not-married Latter-day Saint couple, and the conversation got tense, leading the future groom to break ties with the hashtag.

As we established earlier, it is DezNat's unity with church leadership that purportedly grants the movement authority to do what they do on Twitter, so disunity within DezNat posed another threat that also put DezNat on the defensive. 

For example, one account who seemed at least somewhat sympathetic to the movement bemoaned

<h1 style="color:white">"One guy getting angry is a fracture?"</h1>

"Who knew the great #deznat fracture would be about making out."

One of the most prominent DezNat accounts took real issue with these kinds of comments, replying to them to suggest that nothing was wrong with DezNat, and that everything was fine. For example, in response to this tweet, he...

asked whether one person getting upset was really a threat to the health of the movement.
