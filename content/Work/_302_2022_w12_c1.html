# User Generated Content

--

> *Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website.*

Deane Barker, Flying Squirrel CMS Glossary

--

## what examples of user generated content can you think of?

--

> *UGC includes comments, reviews, ratings, etc.*

--

## what user generated content could potentially appear on your websites?

---

# content moderation

--

> *when thinking of moderators, I think of people that are keeping an eye on what ever they are looking over. For example, like a twitch mod, they make sure nothing gets out of hand in a chat.*

Britt Strong

--

> *Moderators are just chaperones for online socializing.*

Gin Grizzell-Justice

# content moderation

Gillespie, T. (2018). *Custodians of the internet: Platforms, content moderation, and the hidden decision that shape social media.* Yale University Press

> *Social media platforms arose out of the exquisite chaos of the web. Many were designed by people who were inspired by (or at least hoping to profit from) the freedom the web promised, to host and extend all that participation, expression, and social connection.*

--

> *But as these platforms grew, that chaos and contention quickly found its way back onto them, and for obvious reasons: if I want to say something, whether it is inspiring or reprehensible, I want to say it where others will hear me.*

--

> *Social media platforms put more people in direct contact with one another, afford them new opportunities to speak and interact with a wider range of people, and organize them into networked publics.*

--

> *Though the benefits of this may be obvious, and even seem utopian at times, the perils are also painfully apparent, more so every day: the pornographic, the obscene, the violent, the illegal, the abusive, and the hateful.*

# "content moderation" and "free speech" are not the same thing! 

---

# content moderation and free speech *can* overlap...

--

> *In India, Twitter’s third largest market, the company filed a case earlier this year to contest the government’s order to remove individual pieces of content as well as whole accounts that the government considers a risk to India’s security or sovereignty.*

Elliott, V. (2022, November 7). Elon Musk has put Twitter's free speech in danger. *WIRED*. https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-free-speech-musk-takeover/

--

## ... but content moderation is rarely a violation of free speech

--
> *Since YouTube is private company, they have their own set of rules and if users wants to use the platform they must follow the policies.*

Kusmira Pandey

---

# all platforms moderate

--

> *Platforms must moderate, while also disavowing it*

Gillespie, T. (2018). *Custodians of the internet: Platforms, content moderation, and the hidden decision that shape social media.* Yale University Press

--

> *It seems like a lot of platforms start off with a very low moderation level then have a sudden shift to much stricter moderation on certain subjects and content*

Chris Frondal

--

> *They show up, insist that they’re the “platform for free speech” without quite understanding what that actually means, and then they quickly discover a whole bunch of fairly fundamental ideas, institute a bunch of rapid (often sloppy) changes… and in the end, they basically all end up in the same general vicinity, with just a few small differences on the margin.*

Masnick, M. (2022, November 2). Hey Elon: Let me help you speed run the content moderation learning curve. *Techdirt*. https://www.techdirt.com/2022/11/02/hey-elon-let-me-help-you-speed-run-the-content-moderation-learning-curve/

# even so-called "free speech" platforms moderate content protected by the first amendment 

--

* Gab does not allow pornography

--

* Parler has banned pictures of poop

--

* Frank Social doesn't allow you to use (some) swear words

--

* Gettr won't let you criticize the site's founders

--

* Truth Social shadowbans left-leaning (and right-leaning!) political content

--

* Musk's Twitter is threatening to crack down on unannounced parody

---

# content moderation is hard

--

## why did YouTube take down a video from the January 6th Committee? 

--

> *content moderation cannot be approached with binary-type thinking—ones and zeros… on or off*

Jared Hyde

--

> *A big part of content moderation is the context of the events and actions.*

Taylor Biggs


--

> *The issue starts when it starts to affect innocent channels, and how to find the fine line.*

Ethan Johnson

---

# scale makes content moderation difficult

--

> *I would say that there are more people posting then people to find the videos that are not within their policies.*

Gin Grizzell-Justice

--

> *I've never really considered how different cultural norms would create this issue for moderators.*

Jacob Hunt

--

> *I feel like this task should be for a group of people. Within such a group, each individual is an expert in some of the regularly used languages within a server.*

Aaliyah Grider


---

# size makes content moderation more controversial

--

> *they're... now... an integral part of the daily communication of the American people*

Joseph Schodrowski

--

> *While tech companies consider themselves to be private companies with selectively created and enforced rules, when you amass a majority of the popularity and desire the public has to offer, you become bound to the rules of the court public opinion.*

Jared Hyde

---

# why not switch?

--

> *I think this is where the freedom of choice is best exercised. If you don't like the community or the rules of a platform just go to another one. *

Chris Frondal

--

> *It seems big tech companies with a wide reach really use the community aspect that people want and the attention of likes and comments to keep people on their platforms*

Zach Schell

--

> *Social Media is absolutely a group effort and one usually signs up due to the influence of friends/family or other outside sources. *

Zach Talley

---

# smaller platforms and interoperability

--

> *Isn't this kind of like how you can log into new sites using a gmail account.*
