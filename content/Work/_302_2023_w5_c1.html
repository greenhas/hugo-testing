# what is content? 

---

# presentation

> *The general concept and processes around modifying content for display in a particular channel, usually through templating. A template applied to content will result in output which is then delivered.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/presentation/)

--

> *Content refers to the message. The same message can be written, spoken, or painted for example.*

Caleb Faris

--

> *going back to our discussion Monday, you askde for types of content, and we mostly gave examples of the presentation of that content. The dichotomy between pictures and Instagram.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/presentation/)


> *I think presentation is something that can make or break the content and adds to the overall messaging behind what you are trying to say.*

Becca Araiza

--

> *I know something that a lot of youtubers discuss regularly is that your title and thumbnail are more important than the actual video itself. You could make the greatest youtube video ever made but if you have an awful thumbnail and title no one will click it in the first place*

# separating content and presentation


> *The idea that content should be separate from presentation is so central to content management that’s it’s become a cliché *

Deane Barker, [Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/examining-the-separation-between-presentation-and-content/)

--

> *I've never heard of this cliché before.*

Jared Hyde

--

> *Why is this concept very overgeneralized?*

##two types of separation:

--

* Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the “presentation” is the use of colors, fonts, etc.

--

* Content from other content, so Content A is independent from Content B, and the “presentation” is the potential combination of the two

# why separate content from presentation? 

--

> *Because the fonts, colors, and structure could be specific to a certain format or medium.*

--

> *The Kernel definitely is different from other outlets for content as they are a physical newspaper*

Michael Kinser

--

> *You could not take the design of a newspaper and basically copy the exact way it looks with wordpress and be done, it would not be appealing to a user.*

Jacob Hunt

--

> *Content presented on the Kernel is written by writers whereas it is presented by a different design team*

# can you really separate content from presentation?

--

> *Presentation is the glitter, a speech during a ceremony, or the words (verbal or written) to talk about a new product/service. Content is the matter being spoken of.*

Gin Grizzell-Justice

--

> *For example, in political discourse, there is a tendency to think of presentation as “rhetoric,” separating the content of what is said (the truth) from how it is presented (the rhetoric); thus, the “Straight Talk Express” and the “No-Spin Zone.” This separation, of course, is ancient; as Gideon Burton notes in the “Silva Rhetoricae,” rhetoricians have long created and used a distinction “between what is communicated through language and how this is communicated.”*

Clark (2008)

# can you really separate content from presentation?

> *If content is meant for consumption shouldn't it be right to always have a form of presentation linked so it is understood?*

Zach Schell

--

> *I believe in order to be consumed all content has to have some degree of presentation, or we wouldnt pay attention to it*
