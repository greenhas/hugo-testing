# "Google was terrified that Apple would end up ruling the mobile space. So, to help in the fight against the iPhone at a time when Google had no mobile foothold whatsoever, Android was launched as an open source project."

# "In that era, Google had nothing, so any adoptionâany shred of market shareâwas welcome. Google decided to give Android away for free and use it as a trojan horse for Google services."

# " What many people think of as "Android" actually falls into two categories: the open parts from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which are the foundation of Android, and the closed source parts, which are all the Google-branded apps."

# "Google's real power in mobile comes from control of the Google appsâmainly Gmail, Maps, Google Now, Hangouts, YouTube, and the Play Store. These are Android's killer apps, and the big (and small) manufacturers want these apps on their phones. Since these apps are not open source, they need to be licensed from Google."

# "While it might not be an official requirement, being granted a Google apps license will go a whole lot easier if you join the Open Handset Alliance. The OHA is a group of companies committed to AndroidâGoogle's Androidâand **members are contractually prohibited from building non-Google approved devices**."

# "While Android is open, it's more of a 'look but don't touch' kind of open. You're allowed to contribute to Android and allowed to use it for little hobbies, but in nearly every area, the deck is stacked against anyone trying to use Android without Google's blessing."
