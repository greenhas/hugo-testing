I believe [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) to be one of the best and most important web technologies out there. I try to keep it alive by consuming as much web content through RSS as I can and by making my content available through RSS feeds. One of the great things about the `Hugo` software that I'm using for this website is the way that it makes it easy to subscribe to all or some of a website's content through RSS. I recommend the [Feedbin RSS service](https://feedbin.com/) (which is paid but allows you to subscribe to Twitter feeds and newsletters through RSS), and [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) is a great option for macOS/iOS users. There are lots of good RSS clients and services out there, and I encourage folks to join me in helping keep it alive as a means of web content consumption.

If you want to subscribe to any of my content through RSS, here are some helpful links:

* [all content on this website](/index.xml)
* [all long-form blog posts](/tags/macro/index.xml)
* [all microblog posts](/tags/micro/index.xml)
* [all linkblog posts](/tags/link/index.xml)
* [all **Myself** content](/myself/index.xml)
* [all **Relationships** content](/relationships/index.xml)
* [all **Work** content](/work/index.xml)
* [all **Communities** content](/communities/index.xml)

You can even get more specific than this! I try to use consistent and regular tags in my writing. If you're interested in a particular subject, head to the [tags](/tags/) page of this website and bring up one of the tags. Then add `index.xml` to the end of the URL and pop that into a feedreader to subscribe to only the posts on that subject.
