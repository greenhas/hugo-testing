Mastodon is an open-source, federated social media platform that allows users to set up distinct *instances* that can (usually) communicate with each other. I've been interested in this idea for a long time and think it keeps what I like about platforms like Twitter while getting rid of some of the problems inherent to big, powerful platforms (I like Cory Doctorow's write-up [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/make-social-media-work-better-make-it-fail-better-0)). 

When buzz started in April 2022 about a change of ownership at Twitter, I decided this was a chance to really try this out, and I've set up a few Mastodon accounts. Like the distinct sections on this website, these different accounts cover different areas of my life: 

* my [Myself](/myself) posts get redirected to [@spgreenhalgh@tooting.ch](https://tooting.ch/@spgreenhalgh), a Swiss-based instance, where I also publish other posts on personal interests and projects
* my [Relationships](/relationships) posts get redirected to [@spgreenhalgh@dads.cool](https://dads.cool/@spgreenhalgh), a parenting-focused instance, where I also publish other posts on family life and friendships
* my [Work](/work) posts get redirected to [@spgreenhalgh@scholar.social](https://scholar.social/@spgreenhalgh), an academia-focused instance, where I also publish other posts on teaching and research
* my [Communities](/communities) posts currently don't have a home; I'm considering self-hosting an instance where I can post about politics and religion

**All** of my posts also get redirected to my [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/spgreenhalgh) account (which actually also does the `RSS ➡️ Mastodon` forwarding for me as well). I haven't left [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spgreenhalgh) yet but am still trying to figure out what to do there, so it's a bit empty for the time being.
